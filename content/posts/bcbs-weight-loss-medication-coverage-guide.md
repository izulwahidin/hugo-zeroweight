## Unlocking BCBS Coverage for Weight Loss Medications: A 2026 Guide

The quest for coverage of modern, highly effective anti-obesity medications is a top concern for millions of Americans, especially as the landscape of health benefits shifts dramatically in 2026. This comprehensive guide provides the authoritative, actionable steps required to navigate the complexities of Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) coverage for weight loss drugs, including the popular GLP-1 agonists like Wegovy and Zepbound. Success in securing coverage hinges not on a blanket policy, but on specific, documented medical necessity and a thorough understanding of your particular plan's rules.

### The Direct Answer: Does Blue Cross Blue Shield Cover Anti-Obesity Drugs?

The most critical truth for members is that Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) coverage for weight loss medications—including next-generation drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound—**varies drastically by the specific plan and the selections made by your employer**. Due to the unprecedented cost and utilization of these therapies, many commercial BCBS plans now require an employer to purchase an expensive, separate "rider" to include anti-obesity drugs in the pharmacy benefit. For instance, **recent reports from regional plans like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BCBSMA) confirm a trend of excluding GLP-1 agonists for obesity from core commercial pharmacy benefits starting in 2026**, unless this optional coverage rider is secured by the employer group. Therefore, a generic "yes" or "no" answer does not exist; the coverage is wholly dependent on the fine print of your group's contract.

### Establishing Trust: Why Navigating Your Specific Plan is Crucial

Given the steep financial considerations that have driven many commercial plans to implement coverage exclusions starting in 2026, the single most important action for any member is to **review their plan's specific formulary (drug list) and medical policy to determine coverage status**. Accessing this documentation is the first step toward maximizing your chances of approval. This detailed guide is constructed to break down the necessary steps, including the strict eligibility criteria (such as BMI and comorbidity) and the mandatory prior authorization process, ensuring you have the documentation needed to make a strong, well-supported case for medical necessity to your insurer.

## The Core Challenge: Why Weight Loss Coverage is Never Guaranteed

Securing coverage for a prescription weight loss medication, even one that is FDA-approved, is arguably the most challenging aspect of using your health insurance benefits for chronic weight management. The complexity stems not from medical necessity but from a series of contractual and financial policy decisions made by Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) in concert with your employer.

### Understanding the BCBS Formulary and Policy Exclusions

The primary barrier to coverage is a specific contractual exception known as the **"cosmetic exclusion" clause**. If your specific BCBS plan’s policy excludes drugs "primarily for weight loss" or "aesthetic purposes," coverage will be denied—even for revolutionary, FDA-approved drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound. The only way to bypass this blanket denial is if your employer has purchased an expensive, optional rider to specifically add this benefit back into the plan.

To truly understand your benefit, you must check your plan’s **Prescription Drug List (Formulary)**. This document is the ultimate arbiter of what your insurance will and will not cover. Medications are meticulously categorized into one of three critical statuses that directly impact your access and copay:

* **Preferred (Tier 1/2):** Lower copay, generally covered.
* **Non-Preferred (Tier 3/4):** Higher copay, often requires Prior Authorization or Step Therapy.
* **Excluded (Non-Covered):** This status means **no coverage** will be provided, regardless of medical necessity, as the drug is completely removed from the list of covered benefits.

### The GLP-1 Agonist Update: Saxenda, Wegovy, and Zepbound in 2026

The landscape for injectable anti-obesity medications, specifically the GLP-1 agonists like Saxenda, Wegovy (semaglutide), and Zepbound (tirzepatide), is undergoing a dramatic financial-driven shift starting in 2026. Due to the high annual cost of these medications—often exceeding $10,000 per patient—major regional BCBS plans are implementing widespread benefit exclusions.

Reports from BCBS entities, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BCBSMA) 2026 formulary updates, confirm a strong trend among commercial plans to **exclude all GLP-1 medications for the sole indication of obesity** upon plan renewal. This is a critical distinction: these exclusions are driven by cost management strategies for commercial plans. While the GLP-1 drugs remain covered for their other FDA-approved indication—Type 2 Diabetes—their use for weight management is being systematically removed from standard pharmacy benefits unless an employer pays a significant premium for the additional coverage rider.

For members whose plans renew on January 1, 2026, or later in the year, this means previous authorizations for a weight loss drug may expire immediately upon the renewal date, as the medication itself is removed from the list of covered benefits. This financial rationale, which aims to stabilize overall premium costs, is the most authoritative reason for the current uncertainty surrounding the **weight loss medication covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield**.

## Checking Your Eligibility: Medical Criteria for Coverage Approval

Securing coverage for a weight loss medication, such as the new wave of GLP-1 agonists, hinges entirely on demonstrating **medical necessity** through strict clinical criteria. Your Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) plan, which operates under a commitment to established healthcare standards, will require precise, documented proof that your weight management is not for cosmetic purposes but is instead a crucial part of managing a chronic disease.

### Required BMI and Comorbidity Documentation for Anti-Obesity Agents

For nearly all BCBS plans that elect to cover anti-obesity medications, the fundamental entry criteria are based on your Body Mass Index (BMI) and the presence of co-existing health conditions.

* **Obesity:** The most straightforward path to eligibility is having a **BMI of $\ge 30 \text{ kg/m}^2$** (Class I, II, or III obesity).
* **Overweight with Comorbidity:** Alternatively, you may be eligible with a **BMI of $\ge 27 \text{ kg/m}^2$** (overweight) if you have at least one documented weight-related comorbidity. Examples of such conditions commonly cited in BCBS clinical policies include hypertension (high blood pressure), dyslipidemia (abnormal cholesterol levels), Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or obstructive sleep apnea.

To establish credibility for coverage, your physician must provide documentation of these numbers and diagnoses at the time of the prescription request. BCBS, in adherence to established clinical guidelines, views the treatment of obesity as a medical necessity only when a significant health risk is present, which these thresholds define.

### The 'Tried and Failed' Requirement: Prior Weight Loss Program Participation

Beyond meeting the initial BMI and comorbidity criteria, a major requirement for anti-obesity drug approval is demonstrating that you have already attempted and failed at non-pharmacological weight management strategies. This is a core component used to ensure the recommended treatment aligns with evidence-based best practices for comprehensive care.

To establish the authority and credibility of your claim, note that most BCBS clinical policies for anti-obesity agents stipulate a need for a recent, physician-supervised weight loss program. This typically requires a documented trial of a reduced-calorie diet, increased physical activity, and behavioral modification for a minimum period, often **three to six months**, prior to the initiation of medication. For instance, specific Blue Cross Blue Shield plans require a 6-month trial of a comprehensive weight loss plan prior to authorizing a drug like Wegovy. Programs that do not involve direct professional supervision, such as simple online tracking, may not meet this stringent requirement.

### Approval for Continuation: Proving Treatment Effectiveness

Obtaining initial approval is only the first hurdle; coverage is typically not open-ended. All major anti-obesity medications are meant for chronic use, but coverage continuation hinges on their effectiveness for the individual patient.

BCBS policy mandates that your physician must submit re-authorization requests periodically (e.g., every 6 months) that prove the medication is working. Specifically, **re-approval for continued therapy is tied to a documented minimum weight loss.** In line with widely accepted clinical standards, BCBS policies often require you to achieve and document **at least 4% or 5% loss of your baseline body weight within the first 12 to 16 weeks** of therapy. Failure to meet this initial benchmark suggests the current drug is not positively impacting your health and will likely result in the denial of subsequent coverage.

## The Prior Authorization Power Play: Securing Coverage with Documentation

Prior Authorization (PA) is nearly **always required** for brand-name anti-obesity drugs, especially high-cost injectables like Wegovy and Zepbound. This process is the formal mechanism by which Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) plans, often administered by a Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) like Prime Therapeutics, verify that a medication meets their strict medical necessity criteria. Without a successful PA, you will be responsible for the drug’s full cash price, which can exceed $\$1,200$ per month.

### Step-by-Step Prior Authorization (PA) Process for Your Prescriber

The burden of the PA process falls to your healthcare provider (HCP), who must submit a formal request detailing your medical history and clinical rationale for the specific medication. To maximize your chance of approval, the documentation must be precise and comprehensive.

For a successful initial Prior Authorization submission, your HCP must precisely document the following clinical evidence:

* **Baseline Metrics:** Your current weight, height, and **baseline Body Mass Index (BMI)**, clearly showing a BMI $\ge 30 \text{ kg/m}^2$ (obesity) or $\ge 27 \text{ kg/m}^2$ (overweight) with documented comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia).
* **Comorbidity Evidence:** Specific documentation and recent lab results confirming any weight-related comorbidity (e.g., A1C levels for pre-diabetes, blood pressure readings for hypertension).
* **Proof of Prior Attempts:** Detailed records of prior attempts at weight loss, including at least three to six months of a physician-supervised weight management program encompassing a reduced-calorie diet, increased physical activity, and behavioral modifications. This demonstrates that lifestyle changes alone have not been sufficiently effective, which is a key requirement in most BCBS clinical policies.
* **Rationale for Specific Drug:** A clear clinical justification for why the requested anti-obesity drug (e.g., Wegovy) is medically necessary and superior to the alternatives listed on the plan’s formulary (e.g., Orlistat or Phentermine/Topiramate).

Missing a single piece of required information is a common reason for an automatic initial denial.

### Leveraging Diabetes/Cardiovascular Indications for GLP-1 Coverage

A powerful strategy to secure coverage for GLP-1 medications—even if your plan explicitly excludes anti-obesity drugs—is through an FDA-approved diagnosis other than obesity.

If a GLP-1 drug is prescribed for an FDA-approved indication like **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)** or **cardiovascular risk reduction** (a secondary indication for some drugs in the class, such as semaglutide for patients with established cardiovascular disease), it is generally covered under a separate, less restrictive medical or pharmacy benefit. For example, **Ozempic (semaglutide)** is FDA-approved only for T2D. If your physician can document a T2D diagnosis, the medication is likely to be covered as a diabetes treatment, even if the secondary benefit is weight loss. Similarly, *tirzepatide* (Zepbound for weight loss) is available as *Mounjaro* for T2D.

This distinction is crucial: coverage hinges on the **diagnosis** being treated. When submitting a PA for a GLP-1, the diagnosis code and documentation must clearly support the covered indication (T2D or cardiovascular disease) rather than the excluded one (obesity). BCBS plans are increasingly employing "smart" automated checks to verify a T2D diagnosis and history of other diabetes medications to prevent prescribing these drugs for off-label weight loss.

## Alternatives: Covered Anti-Obesity Medications Beyond GLP-1 Injections

While the newer GLP-1 agonists like Wegovy and Zepbound have dominated the weight loss conversation, their exorbitant cost has led many Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) plans to **exclude them entirely** from their formulary, unless an expensive employer-paid rider is purchased. For the majority of members without such coverage, focusing on alternative, often generic, FDA-approved weight loss medications is a critical and successful step in gaining coverage. Health plans frequently operate on a **"step therapy"** model, meaning you must first attempt and fail a preferred, lower-cost drug before they will consider covering a non-preferred, specialty medication.

### First-Line Covered Medications: Orlistat and Phentermine/Topiramate (Qsymia)

The most likely anti-obesity agents to be covered on a standard BCBS prescription drug list are older, more established drugs that have a generic option. These medications are not only cost-effective for the insurer but have a well-documented history of clinical effectiveness, establishing the necessary clinical authority for your treatment plan.

The most prominent example is **Orlistat**, which is available in a prescription-strength form (**Xenical**) and is often a Tier 1 or Tier 2 drug, meaning it is covered with a minimal copay. Similarly, the combination drug **Phentermine/Topiramate ER (Qsymia)** is widely utilized in chronic weight management. BCBS medical policies confirm that these agents are considered "medically necessary" for patients meeting the standard BMI and comorbidity criteria, though they will still almost certainly require a **Prior Authorization (PA)** to ensure you meet the clinical guidelines. For example, specific BCBS policies require documentation of a physician-supervised weight loss program trial *prior* to starting even these first-line medications.

### Exploring Combination Therapy Options: Contrave (Naltrexone/Bupropion)

Another common agent is **Contrave (Naltrexone/Bupropion)**, which combines two existing medications to address cravings and appetite. This combination therapy offers a different mechanism of action and is often included on formularies for chronic weight management. Like other first-line agents, it may be subject to step therapy requirements, where a plan may require a trial of generic Orlistat first.

Understanding the massive cost disparity between these alternatives and the newer, injectable drugs underscores the importance of a step-therapy approach.

| Medication Type | Example | Estimated Out-of-Pocket Cost (Without Coverage) | Estimated Cost with Basic BCBS Coverage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GLP-1 Injectable** | Wegovy/Zepbound | $\$$1,200 - $\$$1,500 per month | $\$$0 (if excluded) to $\$$500+ (high copay) |
| **Generic Alternative** | Orlistat (Generic Xenical) | $\$$60 - $\$$150 per month | $\$$10 - $\$$50 per month (Tier 1/2 Copay) |
| **Combination Therapy** | Contrave | $\$$800 - $\$$1,000 per month | $\$$50 - $\$$200 per month (Non-Preferred Tier) |

This tangible difference in pricing is why these alternatives are so critical in a coverage strategy. If your BCBS plan excludes GLP-1 injections due to cost, proving that you have attempted, tolerated, and ultimately *failed* to achieve a clinically meaningful weight loss (typically a $5\%$ reduction in baseline weight) on a covered, preferred alternative is often the **mandatory preceding step** to get an exception or approval for a non-preferred or specialty tier medication.


## What to Do When Coverage is Denied: The Appeal Process

A denial of coverage for a critical weight loss medication like a GLP-1 agonist can feel like a complete roadblock, but it is rarely the final word. Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS), like all health plans, has a formal, multi-stage process for disputing a decision, and understanding these steps is vital for securing coverage. The key to overturning a denial is a robust, evidence-based presentation of medical necessity, often focusing on the patient’s history and the failure of alternative treatments. The process begins with an internal review and can proceed to an external, independent assessment. 

### Filing a Formal Appeal: Internal vs. External Review

If your prescription for a weight loss medication is denied, the first required step is filing an **Internal Appeal**. This is a formal, written request submitted directly to BCBS, asking them to reconsider their initial adverse benefit determination. You, or your authorized representative (typically your prescribing physician), have the right to challenge the decision. During this stage, a different team or individual within BCBS reviews your case to ensure a "full and fair review," as mandated by federal regulations. To maximize your chances of a reversal, your appeal must provide **new, compelling clinical evidence** that was not fully considered in the initial prior authorization (PA) request. This may include updated lab results, recent clinical notes on co-morbidity progression (e.g., worsening hypertension), or detailed documentation of weight loss plateauing on a previously approved medication.

If your internal appeal is unsuccessful and BCBS upholds its denial, you have the right to request an **External Review**. This is a critical consumer protection step required by federal and state law. The external review sends your case to an **Independent Review Organization (IRO)**—a third-party body composed of medical experts not affiliated with BCBS. Since the IRO’s decision is binding, this is often the most effective opportunity to overturn a denial based on "lack of medical necessity" or "cosmetic exclusion." For medically urgent cases, an **expedited external review** may be available, which typically provides a decision within 72 hours, though standard reviews can take up to 45 days.

### Using a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) to Challenge the Decision

The most impactful document in any appeal is the **Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN)**. This is not a simple form; it is a meticulously crafted clinical argument written by your prescribing physician. The LMN must clearly articulate why the specific, denied drug (e.g., Wegovy) is **medically superior or necessary** for you compared to the covered alternatives (like Orlistat or Qsymia) that BCBS might recommend.

For a successful appeal, the LMN should be a comprehensive, **Atomic Takeaway** for the reviewer, addressing the following points with precision:

* **Diagnosis and Severity:** Detail your specific diagnosis, including your current BMI and the ICD-10 codes for all relevant weight-related co-morbidities (e.g., Type 2 Diabetes, sleep apnea, heart failure).
* **Prior Treatment Failure:** Provide explicit documentation of all prior attempts at weight management—lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise), behavioral counseling, and trials of preferred formulary medications. This must include the start/stop dates and the clinical reasons for failure (e.g., lack of efficacy, intolerable side effects).
* **Targeted Rationale:** Explain the mechanism of action of the denied drug and why it specifically addresses your unique medical profile better than the covered alternatives. For instance, if you have Type 2 Diabetes, the LMN should emphasize the dual metabolic benefit of a GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist beyond mere weight loss.

This level of detailed, patient-specific documentation establishes the necessary medical authority and credibility, positioning the denial as contrary to established clinical guidelines and increasing the likelihood of the denial being reversed.


## Beyond Drugs: BCBS Coverage for Comprehensive Weight Management

Successfully managing chronic conditions, including obesity, requires a multi-faceted approach that extends well beyond prescription medication. Many Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) plans recognize the value of comprehensive care and, even when specific weight loss drugs are excluded, often provide coverage for surgical interventions and crucial support services. This holistic perspective is gaining traction, particularly as organizations like the **World Health Organization (WHO)** and the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** formally define obesity as a chronic disease. This designation provides a critical foundation for establishing the medical necessity of all evidence-based treatments, not just pharmaceutical options.

### Coverage for Bariatric Surgery and Pre-Surgical Requirements

For individuals with severe obesity, bariatric surgery remains one of the most effective long-term treatments. The good news is that most BCBS plans **do cover bariatric surgery**, including procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. However, this coverage is subject to stringent medical necessity criteria designed to ensure patient safety and the likelihood of successful outcomes.

Typically, members must meet high Body Mass Index (BMI) and comorbidity thresholds. A standard requirement is a BMI $\ge 40 \text{ kg/m}^2$, or a BMI $\ge 35 \text{ kg/m}^2$ with at least one severe weight-related comorbidity (like severe sleep apnea or uncontrolled type 2 diabetes). Crucially, this coverage is not automatic. Plans almost universally require a **multi-month, physician-supervised weight loss program** *before* authorization is granted. This pre-surgical requirement, often lasting three to six months, documents the member's commitment to lifestyle changes and is a non-negotiable step in the Prior Authorization (PA) process for surgery.

### Behavioral & Nutritional Counseling: Tapping into Covered Services

Medication and surgery are tools, but sustainable weight management relies heavily on behavioral change and nutritional education. BCBS plans frequently offer coverage for outpatient services that support these essential components, which are often covered under a separate benefit from pharmaceuticals and are therefore less subject to the strict 'weight loss exclusion' clauses.

Members can typically access coverage for:

* **Nutrition Counseling:** Services provided by a **Registered Dietitian (RD)** are key to developing personalized, sustainable eating habits. Many plans cover a specific number of sessions annually, especially when a diagnosis like obesity, diabetes, or hypertension is present.
* **Behavioral Health Counseling:** Addressing the psychological and emotional factors that contribute to weight management is critical. Coverage for behavioral health counseling or therapy helps members develop coping mechanisms, manage stress eating, and sustain motivation.

These services represent the evidence-based core of any successful long-term weight management strategy. By actively utilizing covered nutrition and behavioral health benefits, you establish a documented history of engaging in a comprehensive, medically-supervised program. This documentation not only aids in long-term success but also significantly strengthens any future **Prior Authorization (PA)** or appeal requests for specialty weight loss medications or surgical procedures, proving a robust commitment to your health journey.

## Your Top Questions About BCBS Weight Loss Coverage Answered

### Q1. Is Ozempic covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield for weight loss?

The direct and authoritative answer is **no, not typically for weight loss alone**. Ozempic (semaglutide) is an FDA-approved medication *specifically* for the management of **Type 2 Diabetes** and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with Type 2 Diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. When a healthcare provider prescribes it for weight reduction without a Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis, this is considered **"off-label"** use. Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) plans generally *deny* coverage for off-label prescriptions, especially those for chronic conditions like obesity, which many commercial plans exclude entirely. For weight loss, the plan would require a prescription for the medication **Wegovy**, which contains the same active ingredient (semaglutide) but is specifically FDA-approved for chronic weight management. However, as numerous BCBS regional plans have announced for 2026, **Wegovy and similar anti-obesity agents are often being excluded** from standard commercial formularies unless the employer purchases an expensive add-on rider, underscoring the necessity of checking your plan’s specific documentation.

### Q2. What is the difference between a formulary exclusion and prior authorization?

Understanding the difference between a formulary exclusion and a prior authorization (PA) is critical to navigating your coverage and avoiding unexpected costs.

| Coverage Term | What It Means | Outcome for Member |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Formulary Exclusion** | The drug is **never** covered by the plan, regardless of your medical condition or documentation. It is permanently removed from the list of covered medications (the formulary). | You will pay the **full cash price** of the drug. Coverage **cannot be appealed**. |
| **Prior Authorization (PA)** | The drug *can* be covered, but your doctor must submit a formal request and prove that you meet the plan's strict, specific medical necessity criteria (e.g., BMI, comorbidities, prior treatment attempts). | If the PA is approved, the drug is covered according to your plan’s benefits (copay/coinsurance). If denied, you can file an appeal. |

An **exclusion** is the ultimate barrier to coverage; if your desired anti-obesity medication is excluded, there is no appeal process to obtain coverage under your standard pharmacy benefit.

### Q3. Can I use a manufacturer coupon if my BCBS plan doesn't cover my medication?

The ability to use a manufacturer coupon depends entirely on the type of insurance you possess.

* **Government-Sponsored Plans (Medicare/Medicaid):** You are **statutorily prohibited** from using manufacturer coupons or savings cards if you have government insurance.
* **Commercial BCBS Plans:** You *can* typically use a manufacturer coupon, but its utility is limited. If your BCBS plan **covers** the medication, the coupon will often reduce your copay or coinsurance, and these payments may count toward your deductible and out-of-pocket maximum.
* **Commercial BCBS Plans with an Exclusion:** If the drug is **excluded** from coverage entirely, the manufacturer coupon **will not** cover the full cash price of the medication. The coupon is designed to reduce the patient's *cost-share* (copay/coinsurance), not the plan's payment responsibility. You would still be responsible for the entire, undiscounted cash price, which can easily exceed \$1,000 per month for GLP-1 medications. You should always review the fine print of any manufacturer savings card for specific terms and conditions.


## Final Takeaways: Mastering BCBS Weight Loss Coverage in 2026

The complexity of insurance coverage for anti-obesity medications is a direct result of varying employer benefit choices and the rising costs of novel therapies like GLP-1 agonists. Successfully navigating the Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) landscape requires diligence and clear, direct communication, ensuring you gather the necessary documentation to establish medical necessity, a practice that underpins all high-quality medical care and benefit approvals.

### Your 3 Key Actionable Steps for Guaranteed Clarity

Due to the trend of regional BCBS plans excluding GLP-1 medications for obesity in 2026—a move to manage premium costs as confirmed by recent pharmacy benefit updates from major BCBS organizations—the single most important takeaway is that **coverage is plan-specific**. Generic BCBS coverage does not exist; only your unique policy matters. To cut through the confusion and gather definitive proof of your benefits, call the pharmacy number on your BCBS ID card and ask two specific, clarifying questions:

1.  **"Is my plan's formulary one that *excludes* all anti-obesity agents (e.g., Wegovy, Zepbound) under the pharmacy benefit, or does it cover them with a rider?"** An exclusion means the drug is never covered.
2.  **"If the medication is not excluded, what is the specific Prior Authorization (PA) criteria for the drug I want?"** This defines the medical evidence your doctor must submit for approval, usually referencing a required BMI and comorbidity criteria.

### Next Steps in Your Medically Supervised Weight Loss Journey

Preparing for a prescription starts long before the actual Prior Authorization is submitted. Start gathering documentation now. Your physician will need comprehensive records of your baseline Body Mass Index (BMI), current weight, recent lab results (to confirm comorbidities like hypertension or diabetes), and proof of any past weight management efforts. This record is essential for any PA or appeal process and is a fundamental component of treatment that earns trust and clinical recognition from payers.

A strong, concise call to action is to **Contact your healthcare provider today** with this checklist of coverage requirements. Do not wait for a denial to begin the process. By proactively providing your physician with the exact formulary status and PA requirements obtained from your BCBS plan, you empower them to initiate the proper documentation and Prior Authorization process correctly the first time, significantly increasing your probability of approval and access to covered weight loss medication.
