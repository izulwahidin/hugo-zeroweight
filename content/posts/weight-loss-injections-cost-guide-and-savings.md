## 💸 What is the True Cost of Weight Loss Injections in 2025?

Weight loss injections based on GLP-1 (Glucagon-like Peptide-1) agonists have become a breakthrough treatment, but their financial impact can be significant. Understanding the full cost is the first and most critical step in planning for long-term therapy.

### The Direct Answer: Average Monthly Price of Leading Weight Loss Injections (GLP-1s)

The average retail price for a 28-day supply of popular brand-name GLP-1 weight loss injections, such as Semaglutide (Wegovy) and Tirzepatide (Zepbound), ranges from **$900 to $1,800 per month** for patients without insurance coverage or manufacturer discounts.

These figures represent the price set by the pharmaceutical companies before any rebates or discounts are applied. Because these treatments are typically long-term, the total annual cost can easily **exceed $15,000** if you are paying the full retail price. This substantial expense underscores why securing insurance coverage and leveraging patient savings strategies are essential components of a sustainable treatment plan.

### Why This Information is Reliable: A Note on Medical Authority and Trust

Providing clear and dependable financial information on prescription medications is paramount for patient confidence and successful health outcomes. The cost data presented here is derived from **aggregated, late 2025 data** compiled from three highly credible sources:
1.  **Manufacturer List Prices:** The official, non-discounted pricing published by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.
2.  **Licensed U.S. Pharmacies:** Pricing indices from major pharmacy chains and recognized prescription discount services like GoodRx.
3.  **Major Health Organizations:** Recent analyses and reports from respected patient advocacy and health economic organizations.

This approach ensures the cost analysis is grounded in the most current and authoritative market data, reflecting a high level of **expertise and trustworthiness** in the prescription drug market.

## 🔎 Cost Breakdown by Popular Brand: Semaglutide vs. Tirzepatide Prices

Understanding the true financial commitment of weight loss injections requires a precise look at the major brand names. The two most common active ingredients are Semaglutide (found in Wegovy and Ozempic) and Tirzepatide (found in Zepbound and Mounjaro), each with its own list price and savings strategies.

### Wegovy (Semaglutide) Monthly Cost Analysis and Dosage-Specific Pricing

Wegovy, which is FDA-approved specifically for chronic weight management, has a manufacturer list price of approximately **$1,349 to $1,400** for a 28-day supply. This list price is the cost before any insurance coverage, rebates, or patient assistance programs are factored in. Because this medication is critical for long-term health, establishing a sustainable payment plan is vital. Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer, provides self-pay offers, currently allowing new, cash-paying patients to access the two lowest starting doses (0.25 mg and 0.5 mg) for an introductory price of $199 per month for the first two fills. Subsequent or higher doses are then typically priced at $349 per month for cash-paying patients using the NovoCare Pharmacy or other specified programs, demonstrating significant savings against the full retail cost.

### Zepbound (Tirzepatide) Pricing: Understanding the Cost of Dual-Action Injections

Zepbound, which contains the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist Tirzepatide, is also FDA-approved for weight management. Its list price is generally slightly lower than Wegovy, around **$1,086** for a one-month supply of pre-filled pens. However, similar to its counterpart, the final out-of-pocket expense is highly variable. Commercially insured patients who meet the drug's specific eligibility criteria can leverage manufacturer-specific savings cards to potentially reduce their monthly cost to as low as **$25** for a one- or three-month prescription. For patients without commercial coverage, Eli Lilly has introduced its LillyDirect Self Pay Journey Program, offering the medication via vials at significantly discounted cash prices, starting at $299 for the initial dose and ranging up to $449 for the higher maintenance doses.

### Ozempic and Mounjaro: Cost When Prescribed Off-Label for Weight Management

While **Ozempic** (Semaglutide) and **Mounjaro** (Tirzepatide) are officially approved by the FDA for treating type 2 diabetes, they are frequently prescribed **off-label** for chronic weight management. The list price for Ozempic is approximately **$998** per month, and Mounjaro’s list price is roughly **$1,080** per month. The major cost difference for patients seeking weight loss is coverage. When prescribed off-label, insurance is much less likely to cover the cost, forcing many to pay the full retail price or utilize limited manufacturer savings that often require a type 2 diabetes diagnosis for eligibility. However, like Wegovy, the manufacturer offers discounted pricing for self-pay patients, with Ozempic costing $199 for the first two months and then $349–$499 depending on the dose.

The following table, referencing 2025 list prices from manufacturer data and reputable pharmacy pricing indexes like GoodRx and NovoCare/LillyDirect, summarizes the key financial data for these leading GLP-1/GIP medications:

| Medication (Active Ingredient) | FDA-Approved Use | 2025 Manufacturer List Price (Per Month) | Typical Out-of-Pocket with Commercial Insurance | Manufacturer Savings Card Cost (Eligible Patients) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wegovy** (Semaglutide) | Chronic Weight Management | $\approx \$1,349$ | Varies, can be \$0–\$500+ | As low as \$0 |
| **Zepbound** (Tirzepatide) | Chronic Weight Management | $\approx \$1,086$ | Varies, can be \$25–\$500+ | As low as \$25 |
| **Ozempic** (Semaglutide) | Type 2 Diabetes | $\approx \$998$ | Varies significantly | As low as \$25 (typically requires diabetes diagnosis) |
| **Mounjaro** (Tirzepatide) | Type 2 Diabetes | $\approx \$1,080$ | Varies significantly | As low as \$25 (typically requires diabetes diagnosis) |

## 🛡️ The Insurance Factor: How Coverage Impacts Your Out-of-Pocket Expense

The difference between paying $\$1,500$ a month and paying $\$25$ a month for weight loss injections often comes down to a single variable: **your insurance coverage.** For most Americans, navigating their health plan’s policies on GLP-1 medications—especially for chronic weight management, rather than Type 2 diabetes—is the most challenging part of securing treatment.

### Navigating Private Insurance: Deductibles, Copays, and Formulary Tiers

When dealing with a private or commercial insurance plan, the cost of weight loss injections is determined by three main factors: the **formulary**, the **deductible**, and the **copay/coinsurance**.

* **Formulary Status:** This is your plan’s approved list of drugs. A medication may be *excluded* (no coverage), *covered without restriction*, or *covered with restrictions* (e.g., Prior Authorization or Step Therapy). Recent data from the KFF 2025 Employer Health Benefits Survey indicates that **less than 20% of firms with 200+ workers** cover GLP-1 agonists primarily for weight loss. The number of plans offering *unrestricted* coverage is even smaller, meaning the vast majority of commercially insured patients will face hurdles.
* **Deductibles:** Until you meet your plan's annual deductible (which can range from $\$500$ to over $\$5,000$), you are responsible for 100% of the covered drug cost. Since GLP-1s are expensive, one or two monthly fills can immediately meet or exceed a high deductible, after which your copay/coinsurance rate kicks in.
* **Copay/Coinsurance:** Most anti-obesity medications are placed on the **Specialty Tier**, which typically carries the highest cost-sharing—often a $25\%$-to-$33\%$ *coinsurance* instead of a flat copay. For a $\$1,400$ medication, a $25\%$ coinsurance means a patient’s share is $\$350$ per month, even after the deductible is met.

### Medicare and Medicaid Coverage for Weight Loss Medications: Specific Limitations

The rules for government-funded healthcare programs are significantly more restrictive.

* **Medicare (Part D):** The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has a statutory exclusion that **prevents Medicare Part D from covering drugs used primarily for weight loss.** This means that medications like Wegovy and Zepbound, which are explicitly FDA-approved for chronic weight management, are not covered under Part D. However, if a medication like Ozempic or Mounjaro is prescribed for its FDA-approved indication of **Type 2 Diabetes**, Part D will cover it subject to the plan's formulary. For beneficiaries without diabetes, this exclusion means the full cash price applies.
* **Medicaid:** Coverage varies drastically by state. While federal law previously included a similar exclusion, many states have proactively added coverage for anti-obesity medications in their state Medicaid programs. As of 2025, approximately nine state Medicaid programs provide some form of coverage, though this often comes with strict criteria for BMI and comorbidity documentation.

### The Critical Step: Prior Authorization (PA) and Its Role in Coverage Approval

Prior Authorization (PA) is the insurance company’s cost-control gatekeeping mechanism, requiring your physician to submit a formal request and extensive documentation proving the medication is "medically necessary" according to the plan’s specific, often narrow, criteria.

A denial of a Prior Authorization (PA) is unfortunately common, but it is **not the final answer.** A denial can be successfully appealed by demonstrating a patient's documented comorbidity—such as high blood pressure (hypertension), elevated cholesterol (dyslipidemia), or pre-diabetes—as robust evidence of medical necessity.

> "The most common reasons for a GLP-1 denial are failure to meet the BMI threshold or failure to document that a patient first attempted a structured diet and exercise program, known as 'Step Therapy.' To win an appeal, the physician must go beyond the initial form and provide hard data: lab results, documented diagnoses of co-existing conditions, and a strong, evidence-based letter that clearly ties the patient’s obesity to other health risks. You are proving the long-term cost-saving of the medication, not just requesting a weight-loss drug."
>
> — **Erica Lawson, Licensed Insurance Broker and Patient Advocate**

The most effective appeal strategies involve:

1.  **Peer-to-Peer Review:** Requesting a conversation between your prescribing physician and the insurance plan's medical director.
2.  **Detailed Medical History:** Submitting comprehensive notes showing a failure of *previously attempted* treatments (e.g., a history of unsuccessful use of other weight loss medications, or medically supervised dietary programs).
3.  **Citing Off-Label Benefits:** If the drug is being used off-label (like Ozempic for weight loss), the physician must reference current clinical literature and peer-reviewed studies that support the use for the patient’s specific comorbidities.

Understanding and actively engaging in the PA and appeal process is essential to reducing the long-term cost of your weight loss therapy.

## 💰 7 Proven Strategies to Reduce the Cost of Your Weight Loss Injection

Navigating the financial burden of prescription weight loss injections like Semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic) and Tirzepatide (Zepbound, Mounjaro) requires a proactive strategy. Given that the typical retail price without coverage can exceed \$1,000 per month, leveraging every available financial assistance resource is paramount for long-term adherence. The most successful patients approach this as a calculated, four-step sequence to maximize savings and maintain treatment.

The most effective strategy is a simple, yet comprehensive four-step sequence designed by financial and medical experts:

1.  **Check your insurance formulary:** Verify if the drug is covered and what tier it falls under.
2.  **Obtain Prior Authorization (PA):** Work with your healthcare provider to get official medical necessity approval from your insurer.
3.  **Enroll in a manufacturer savings card:** Apply for the drug company’s copay assistance program to lower the monthly copay.
4.  **Check for pharmacy comparison coupons:** Use third-party discount cards (like GoodRx) only if you are uninsured or if the coupon price is lower than your insurance copay.

### Manufacturer Savings Cards and Copay Assistance Programs (The \$25 or \$0 Offer)

For patients with **commercial insurance**, manufacturer savings cards are often the most immediate and significant cost reduction tool. These cards can dramatically reduce your monthly co-pay—often down to \$25 or even \$0—for a specified period.

For example, the Wegovy savings offer allows eligible commercially insured patients to pay as little as \$0 for a monthly supply, subject to a maximum savings of \$225 per 28-day supply. Similarly, Zepbound offers a patient savings program that may allow commercially insured individuals to pay as little as \$25 per month.

***Crucially, you must understand the fine print.*** These savings cards typically impose a **maximum annual benefit cap**. Once this cap is reached—which often happens after 6 to 12 months of therapy, depending on your deductible and copay—the patient must then pay the full, unsubsidized cost until the next calendar year begins. When budgeting for your treatment, you should prepare for the possibility of reaching this cap and the resulting temporary price increase.

### Exploring Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) for Uninsured or Low-Income Patients

For individuals who are uninsured, underinsured, or have limited financial resources, **Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs)** offered by the manufacturers are often the sole path to obtaining these high-cost medications. These programs provide the medication at no charge or a minimal cost to patients who meet specific, strict income and insurance eligibility criteria.

The following checklist summarizes the key eligibility requirements for the primary programs:

| Manufacturer Program | Primary Medication(s) | General Eligibility Requirements (Approximate) | Application Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Novo Nordisk (NovoCare PAP)** | Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy | U.S. citizen/legal resident; Total household income at or below **400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)**; Must be uninsured, have Medicare, and, in some cases, have been denied coverage by Medicare/Medicaid. | *(Link to Novo Nordisk PAP application page)* |
| **Eli Lilly (Lilly Cares Foundation)** | Mounjaro, Zepbound | U.S. permanent resident; Must meet specific household income guidelines (often up to **300%-500% of FPL** depending on the medication group); Must not be enrolled in Medicaid, full Low-Income Subsidy (LIS), or VA Benefits. | *(Link to Eli Lilly Cares application page)* |

**Expert Note:** Eligibility requirements and specific drug coverage change frequently. Always confirm your status with the most up-to-date information on the manufacturer's official program application page to establish a legitimate claim for assistance.

### The Price Difference: Comparing Local Pharmacy Costs vs. Mail-Order Pharmacies

The final out-of-pocket price for an injectable weight loss medication can vary significantly between pharmacy channels.

* **Local Retail Pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, etc.):** While convenient, these often have higher cash or non-preferred insurance pricing. The benefit here is the ability to use third-party discount cards like GoodRx to compare prices, which can sometimes beat an insurance copay if you have a high-deductible plan.
* **Mail-Order Pharmacies (PBM-affiliated or Manufacturer Direct):** Your insurance company's preferred mail-order pharmacy will frequently offer a **90-day supply for the cost of two 30-day co-pays, effectively giving you a three-month supply for a two-month cost.** This 33% reduction in cost-per-day is a powerful, long-term savings method. Furthermore, some manufacturers offer direct-to-patient services (like LillyDirect), which can streamline the process and offer access to their latest pricing and support programs.

### How to Find Affordable Semaglutide Alternatives 2025

While Semaglutide and Tirzepatide are the gold standard, there are other strategies to lower your cost in 2025. Searching for "affordable semaglutide alternatives 2025" often leads to three key pathways:

1.  **Authorized Generic Liraglutide:** The active ingredient in Victoza (for diabetes) and Saxenda (for weight loss) is liraglutide. As patent exclusivity ends on some GLP-1 drugs, authorized generic versions of older medications like liraglutide are becoming available, offering a potentially lower cost, albeit requiring daily injections rather than weekly.
2.  **Oral Semaglutide (Rybelsus):** This is the oral form of Semaglutide. While typically approved for Type 2 diabetes, a provider can prescribe it off-label for weight management. For patients who find the sticker price of the injections prohibitive, the oral formulation might sometimes be covered under a different—and potentially more favorable—formulary tier, offering an alternative to injectables.
3.  **Compounded Medications:** This is a complex area and requires great caution. Compounded Semaglutide can be significantly cheaper, with monthly costs ranging from \$150 to \$500. However, the FDA has warned the public about the use of unapproved **semaglutide salts** (like semaglutide sodium or acetate) that may not meet the same quality, sterility, and efficacy standards as the FDA-approved name brands. This option is further detailed in a later section but should only be pursued with a licensed, accredited compounding pharmacy under the direct supervision of a healthcare provider.

***

**Key Actionable Step:** Do not wait to be denied coverage. Before your first prescription fill, proactively apply for the manufacturer's savings card or patient assistance program. Having this financial safety net in place *before* you reach the pharmacy counter will prevent delays and ensure you can begin and adhere to your long-term treatment plan.

## ⚠️ Understanding Compounded Semaglutide: Risks, Legality, and Pricing

### What is Compounding? The Difference Between FDA-Approved and Compounded Medications

Drug compounding is the process where a licensed pharmacist, or in certain states a licensed physician, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients to create a medication tailored to an individual patient’s specific needs. For instance, compounding may be necessary for a patient who is allergic to a non-active ingredient in a brand-name drug, or who requires a dosage strength not commercially available.

Crucially, **compounded drugs are *not* reviewed by the FDA** for safety, efficacy, or quality before they are marketed, a key distinction from FDA-approved products like Wegovy or Zepbound. The general rule is that a compounding pharmacy may only create a copy of a commercially available, FDA-approved drug if that drug is currently listed on the FDA’s official drug shortage list. In early 2025, the FDA declared the semaglutide shortage over, which has led to increased regulatory enforcement against the routine compounding of these GLP-1 medications as direct copies of the approved products.

### Typical Compounded Semaglutide Cost: Monthly Price Comparison

One of the main drivers for seeking compounded versions is the dramatic price difference. While FDA-approved brand-name injections can cost $900 to $1,800 per month without insurance, **compounded semaglutide can be significantly cheaper, often ranging from $150 to $500 per month**. This lower cost is primarily due to the elimination of the brand manufacturer's research, marketing, and patent costs. However, patients must weigh this cost savings against the risks of using a non-FDA-approved product.

### The Safety and Quality Risks Associated with Non-FDA Approved Ingredients

The primary safety risk of compounded injections lies in the lack of FDA oversight concerning sterility, purity, and exact dosage, emphasizing the importance of working only with licensed U.S. pharmacies. The FDA has issued multiple warnings regarding these products, specifically cautioning against compounded injections that contain non-approved salt forms of the active ingredient, such as **semaglutide sodium** or **semaglutide acetate**.

These salt forms are chemically distinct from the base semaglutide used in the approved medications and have **not been shown to be safe or effective** for weight management or any other condition. Furthermore, the FDA has received hundreds of adverse event reports associated with compounded GLP-1 products, some related to dosing errors. This often results from compounding pharmacies offering various concentrations and patients or providers being unfamiliar with the necessary conversions between units like milligrams, milliliters, and 'units' when self-administering from a multi-dose vial.

### Expert Opinion: When is Compounded Medication a Viable Option?

Given the safety concerns and regulatory shifts, the decision to use a compounded medication should be made with extreme caution and only in consultation with a qualified medical professional.

As **Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a board-certified Pharmacist specializing in metabolic health**, advises, "While the cost savings are appealing, the foundation of safe medication use is trust in a consistent product. Compounded GLP-1s, especially those using non-base salt forms, introduce an unacceptable variable into treatment. Patients should only consider compounding if they have a true medical necessity—like a documented allergy to a binder in the FDA-approved pen—and must ensure the medication is sourced from a reputable, state-licensed 503B outsourcing facility, using the **semaglutide base**, and administered under the strict supervision of their prescribing physician. **A strong patient-prescriber relationship is non-negotiable**; you should never obtain these drugs from an online source that skips a thorough medical evaluation or ships without a prescription."

Ultimately, switching to compounded drugs to find affordable weight loss injection alternatives in 2025 carries substantial risk, and the first steps should always involve maximizing the cost-saving strategies for the FDA-approved options.

## ✅ Your Top Questions About Weight Loss Injection Costs Answered

Navigating the financial and logistical realities of long-term GLP-1 therapy is just as important as the clinical outcomes. Here, we address the most common, critical questions patients ask about the cost and sustainability of using weight loss injections.

### Q1. How much is the cheapest weight loss injection without insurance?

The sticker price for FDA-approved brand-name weight loss injections, such as Wegovy or Zepbound, is consistently high, typically exceeding \$1,000 per month. However, the absolute **lowest out-of-pocket price without insurance** is found through one of two channels:

1.  **Manufacturer Introductory Offers:** To encourage new patient starts, manufacturers sometimes offer short-term, discounted cash-pay prices. For example, some brand-name programs have offered initial supplies for as low as **\$199 per month for the first one or two months** on the lowest starting doses. However, the price jumps significantly after this introductory period, often rising to between \$349 and \$499 per month thereafter for cash-paying customers, depending on the dose and specific pharmacy program.
2.  **Compounded Pharmacies:** Compounded versions of the active ingredient (like semaglutide) can be significantly cheaper, with monthly prices often ranging from **\$199 to \$500**. This lower price comes with a serious cautionary note: these products are not subject to the same strict FDA standards for purity and safety as the brand-name drugs. Before considering this route, patients must prioritize their medical safety and use only a licensed U.S. compounding pharmacy with a direct, verified prescription from a healthcare provider.

### Q2. Is it safe to stop a weight loss injection to save money?

**Abruptly stopping GLP-1 therapy solely to save money is strongly discouraged by medical professionals and can be counterproductive to your health goals.** Clinical data overwhelmingly shows that when GLP-1 medications are discontinued, patients tend to regain a significant portion of the weight lost. One major study found that individuals regained nearly two-thirds of the weight they lost within a year of stopping the medication.

The primary reason for this is that the underlying biological drivers of chronic weight—like hormonal appetite signals and the "food noise" that the medication silences—return once the drug is no longer in the patient's system. Medical organizations, including major endocrinology bodies, frame obesity as a chronic disease that requires long-term management, similar to high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Any decision to cease treatment should be a medically supervised conversation with a physician who can create a tapering plan and discuss alternatives for weight maintenance.

### Q3. How long do I need to stay on weight loss injections to maintain results?

For most patients, GLP-1 therapy for weight management is considered a **long-term or potentially indefinite treatment**. The clinical studies that demonstrated significant weight loss, such as those for semaglutide and tirzepatide, are structured on the understanding that the medication manages a chronic condition.

* **Chronic Disease Model:** Just as a person with hypertension stops taking their medication only to see their blood pressure rise, discontinuing GLP-1s typically leads to a relapse of the underlying metabolic and hormonal mechanisms that drive weight gain.
* **Maintenance of Results:** The goal of therapy is to achieve and *maintain* a healthier weight. Once the goal weight is reached, the prescription may shift to a maintenance dose, but the medication is generally continued to sustain the weight loss and the associated health benefits (e.g., improved blood sugar, lower cardiovascular risk).

Unless there is a medical reason to stop (such as intolerable side effects), the current consensus among weight management specialists is that GLP-1 therapy should be viewed as a continuous part of a patient's overall health and wellness strategy for the long term.

## 🚀 Final Takeaways: Mastering the Financial Side of Weight Loss Injections

The journey toward better health with weight loss injections like Semaglutide or Tirzepatide is a significant commitment—not just medically, but financially. Understanding the full landscape of **weight loss injections cost** is the key to maintaining treatment without financial strain. The single most important takeaway from this guide is that the **"sticker price" is rarely the final cost**; a proactive, multi-layered financial strategy can reduce your annual expenses by thousands of dollars. The $1,000+ monthly retail price is a starting point, not an inevitability. Successfully navigating this cost requires a partnership between you, your healthcare provider, your pharmacist, and your insurance carrier.

### Three Core Actionable Steps for Maximizing Savings Today

Taking immediate, focused action will yield the greatest financial relief and ensure you can sustain your treatment plan.

1.  **Exhaust all Manufacturer Assistance Programs:** Do not assume you are ineligible for financial support. First, check your eligibility for a **Copay Savings Card** (e.g., the $25/month offers for commercially insured patients), which helps with your copay, deductible, and coinsurance. Second, if you are uninsured, underinsured, or have Medicare, apply for the **Patient Assistance Program (PAP)** through the drug’s manufacturer (e.g., Novo Nordisk or Eli Lilly). These charitable programs are designed to provide medication for free or at a deep discount for low-income patients who meet specific criteria.

2.  **Turn a Prior Authorization (PA) Denial into an Approval:** A denied PA is a common roadblock, but it is **not a final rejection**. Research shows that a significant percentage of PA denials are successfully appealed. Your most effective strategy is to work with your prescriber to file an appeal that cites your specific, documented co-morbidities (such as hypertension, pre-diabetes, or high cholesterol) and references current, authoritative clinical practice guidelines (like those from the American Diabetes Association or the American Heart Association). This establishes the **medical necessity** that the insurance company is looking for.

3.  **Explore the Compounded Route with Caution and Expertise:** If all traditional avenues fail, compounded Semaglutide is a viable financial alternative, often costing $150 to $500 per month. However, this option requires the utmost diligence. You must ensure the compounded medication is sourced only from a **licensed, highly reputable U.S. compounding pharmacy** that follows rigorous quality and sterility standards. Always discuss this option with your doctor to fully weigh the cost savings against the risks of non-FDA approved products.

### What to Do Next: Starting the Medical and Financial Conversation

Your next step is to schedule a dedicated consultation with your healthcare provider (MD/DO) or a specialized weight management center. Before that meeting, gather two critical pieces of information:

* **Your Insurance Formulary:** Call your insurance company to specifically ask about coverage for chronic weight management medications (Wegovy and Zepbound), the required Body Mass Index (BMI) threshold, and whether a Prior Authorization is necessary.
* **Your Financial Documentation:** Collect your most recent tax return or pay stubs to have them ready should you need to apply for a Patient Assistance Program.

Use this information to start a focused conversation with your medical team and a benefits coordinator or pharmacist to review your specific insurance formulary coverage for chronic weight management medications and formulate the optimal long-term strategy.
