## The Costco Weight Loss Program: Quick Facts and Member Benefits

### The Direct Answer: What Exactly is the Costco Weight Loss Program?

The **Costco Weight Loss Program** is a comprehensive, medical weight management service made available to Costco members through a strategic partnership with the telehealth platform, Sesame. Instead of being a diet plan or a fitness regimen, this is a discounted healthcare offering designed to connect members directly with licensed clinicians for personalized treatment. For a specific, discounted subscription fee, members gain access to virtual clinician consultations and personalized treatment plans, which include ongoing support and, when clinically appropriate, potential prescriptions for highly effective weight loss medications like GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic or Wegovy). This approach integrates professional medical guidance into your weight management journey.

### Establishing Trust: Why Medical Expertise is Critical for Weight Management

Trust in healthcare is paramount, particularly for complex and long-term goals like weight management. The importance of partnering with a professional, licensed medical provider cannot be overstated when pursuing effective, sustainable weight loss. This article’s goal is to provide a complete breakdown of the exact costs, eligibility requirements, and the step-by-step process of the program, offering a transparent, medically-reviewed overview to ensure you have all the facts before making an informed decision about your health.

## Decoding the Sesame Partnership: Service Cost and What's Included

### The Program's Sticker Price: Costco Member vs. Non-Member Costs

The Costco Weight Loss Program is made accessible through a strategic partnership with the direct-pay telehealth platform, Sesame. For a Costco member, the primary program fee is a significantly **discounted rate of $\$179$ for a three-month subscription**. This is a competitive rate designed to encourage initial enrollment, especially when compared to the standard, non-member public rate for comparable online weight loss programs, which is often higher on a monthly or quarterly basis. This pricing structure is specifically optimized to provide members with a high-value entry point for physician-led weight management. As Sesame co-founder and CEO David Goldhill noted, the company's model is built on removing insurance and other unnecessary middlemen, allowing doctors "to compete on price and on the packaging of care," which ultimately results in better savings for the patient.

### Core Services: Virtual Consultations, Labs, and Clinical Support

The $\$179$ subscription fee covers the essential components of the medical weight loss journey. This includes an **initial live video consultation** with a board-certified clinician of the member's choice, followed by three months of **ongoing clinical consultation** and support. This foundational medical oversight is key to establishing reliability in the treatment plan. Throughout the subscription period, members also receive **unlimited messaging support** with their dedicated clinician, which facilitates consistent communication and adherence to the plan. Furthermore, the program includes a **lab order** if clinically necessary, which is a vital step for assessing a patient’s overall health and determining the appropriate course of treatment. **Crucially, however, the subscription fee does not cover the cost of the prescribed medications (like GLP-1 drugs) or the actual cost of any required lab work,** a detail that all prospective participants must carefully factor into their budget.

## Accessing GLP-1 Medications: Ozempic, Wegovy, and the Prescription Process

### Clinical Criteria: Who Qualifies for Weight Loss Medication Prescriptions?

Prescriptions for Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, such as semaglutide (the active ingredient in brand names like Ozempic and Wegovy), are not dispensed lightly. The Costco/Sesame medical team adheres strictly to clinical guidelines and the medications' FDA-approved indications. The prescription is only issued after a live, virtual consultation with a licensed clinician, who confirms that the patient meets the necessary clinical appropriateness.

Typically, this is determined by two main criteria: a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or greater (indicating obesity), or a BMI of 27 or greater (indicating overweight) coupled with at least one weight-related health condition such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol. Beyond these basic metrics, the clinician will conduct a detailed review of your full health history, including any prior weight loss attempts, co-morbidities, and current medications, to ensure the therapy is safe and effective for you. This rigorous process is a critical layer of professional medical oversight, preventing the inappropriate use of powerful weight management drugs. 

### The Real Cost of GLP-1 Drugs: Insurance Coverage and Self-Pay Prices

A crucial point for all potential Costco members to understand is the significant financial distinction between the program’s subscription fee and the cost of the medication itself. While the discounted $179 Sesame fee covers the clinical consultation, lab orders, and ongoing support, **it does not include the cost of any prescribed medication** or required lab work.

This is where the costs escalate dramatically, particularly for those without insurance coverage for anti-obesity medications. Without commercial or government insurance that covers the drugs, self-pay patients should be prepared to budget for the extremely high list price of the brand-name GLP-1 drugs. The average self-pay cost for a one-month supply of name-brand semaglutide (like Ozempic or Wegovy) generally falls between **$\$950$ to $\$1,600$ per month**. This substantial cost is entirely separate from the $179$ program fee, and patients must factor in this long-term, continuous expense.

### Navigating Drug Shortages and Supply Chain Issues

Patients entering the medical weight loss space, especially those seeking GLP-1s, must be aware of the nationwide supply challenges that can impact their treatment continuity. Demand for medications like semaglutide and tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) has frequently outpaced the available supply, leading to intermittent shortages at pharmacies. While the Sesame platform can issue a prescription, it cannot guarantee the immediate availability of the drug at a patient's local pharmacy.

This issue highlights a key consideration for long-term health management: **consistency is vital for safe and effective treatment.** According to a systematic review published in *The New England Journal of Medicine*, once-weekly semaglutide injections led to a mean body weight loss of up to $13.9\%$ over 68 weeks in adults with obesity, demonstrating the profound efficacy of this class of drugs when taken consistently. Disruption to the supply chain can interrupt the titration schedule, potentially requiring a patient to restart at a lower dose to manage gastrointestinal side effects, which underscores the importance of a robust, stable supply for achieving sustainable health outcomes. The telehealth provider and the patient must work together to identify pharmacies with stock or explore alternative formulations, but the supply issue remains an ongoing factor in treatment planning.

## Beyond Medication: The Holistic Approach to Sustainable Weight Loss

The **Costco Weight Loss Program**, delivered via Sesame, is frequently highlighted for its expedited access to prescription weight management tools, but the real power of the service lies in its commitment to a comprehensive, sustained approach. The program is built on the understanding that anti-obesity medications are only one piece of the puzzle; long-term success requires a fundamental shift in daily habits and a strong support network.

### Dietary and Exercise Guidance: The Program's Lifestyle Component

A core tenet of the Sesame program is the development of an **individualized treatment plan** that strategically integrates non-pharmacological interventions. This counseling focuses on healthy eating, increased physical activity, and behavioral modification techniques alongside any prescribed medication. This is not simply a prescription service; it’s a commitment to overhauling the lifestyle factors that contribute to weight gain.

As articulated by board-certified registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) and spokesperson, Dr. Sarah Gleeson, "Relying solely on medication misses the critical opportunity to build the necessary foundation for maintenance. The combination of pharmacology with comprehensive lifestyle changes—**personalized nutrition and consistent movement**—is scientifically proven to yield the most significant and durable results over a patient’s lifetime." The clinical team ensures that dietary and exercise advice is tailored to the member's current health status, preferences, and cultural needs, making the plan practical and sustainable rather than a temporary diet. 

### The Role of Ongoing Clinical Support and Follow-Up Visits

Effective medical weight management is a dynamic process, not a static prescription. The Costco program recognizes this by including **ongoing messaging support** and scheduled **follow-up virtual consultations** as key features. These interactions are critical mechanisms for treatment adherence and safety.

The continuous support allows the virtual clinician to monitor the patient's progress, track side effects, and promptly adjust the medication dosage or the lifestyle component of the plan. This continuous feedback loop ensures the treatment remains optimized. For instance, if a patient is experiencing specific side effects, the clinician can immediately pivot to a different treatment strategy or alter the dietary guidance to minimize discomfort, directly facilitating **adherence** to the plan. This commitment to continuous professional oversight helps establish the expertise and reliability of the care provided.

### Comparing Medical Supervision with Non-Prescription Programs

The greatest differentiator between a medically-supervised program like the one offered by Costco/Sesame and over-the-counter or non-prescription weight loss applications is the level of clinical oversight and personalized treatment adjustment.

Non-prescription programs, while often cheaper, offer generic or one-size-fits-all meal plans and exercise routines. They lack the ability to:
* **Order and interpret laboratory work** to identify underlying metabolic issues.
* **Prescribe and manage** highly effective, but potent, medications like GLP-1 agonists.
* **Provide a safety net** for patients with co-morbidities like heart disease or type 2 diabetes.

By contrast, the **medical supervision** in the Costco program means a licensed clinician is actively managing the patient's care, allowing for precise dosage titration (e.g., gradually increasing the medication to minimize side effects) and ensuring the overall treatment strategy aligns with established clinical guidelines, thus bolstering the clinical expertise and safety of the process.


## User Experiences and Critical Reviews: Is the Costco Program Worth It?

### Analyzing User Success Stories and Weight Loss Outcomes

The introduction of the Costco-partnered weight loss program has been met with significant initial enthusiasm, primarily due to the program's **accessibility and the affordability of the initial consultation**. For many seeking medically-supervised weight management, this telehealth option has streamlined the process of consulting with a clinician and, where clinically appropriate, obtaining a prescription for GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic or Wegovy. Users frequently report that the platform removes the significant barrier of long wait times and high out-of-pocket costs typically associated with the initial in-person visit to a specialist.

To give a clear, multifaceted view of the program's value, we can examine the experiences of different member profiles, aggregated from anonymized user reviews and community feedback:

* **Persona 1: The Insured Patient Seeking Convenience**
    * *Experience:* Praised the low, fixed cost of the initial subscription ($179/three months) as a "fast-track" to getting their medication. Because their commercial insurance largely covered the GLP-1 drug itself, the total out-of-pocket cost for the entire process remained relatively low and predictable. They value the convenience of virtual visits over traveling to a specialist's office.
* **Persona 2: The Self-Pay Patient Facing Sticker Shock**
    * *Experience:* While they appreciated the straightforward clinical assessment and prescription process, they faced significant disappointment when realizing the monthly, self-pay cost of the GLP-1 medication (around \$950 to \$1,600) was separate from the program fee. They found the program an excellent clinical *gateway*, but financially unsustainable long-term without drug coverage.
* **Persona 3: The Lifestyle-Only Seeker**
    * *Experience:* These users, who may not have qualified for or wanted medication, found the ongoing clinical guidance and focus on lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) valuable. They rated the communication with their clinician highly, appreciating the personalized, non-pharmacological support and behavior-change counseling as a key driver of their early success.

### Common Criticisms: Cost Confusion and Customer Service Experience

Despite the positive feedback on accessibility, a **major point of user confusion revolves around the program fee not including the medication cost**, leading to potential sticker shock for uninsured or under-insured members. The initial promotional material, while technically correct, often doesn't adequately prepare patients for the potential \$1,000+ monthly burden of the prescribed drug. This gap in understanding is the most frequent source of negative feedback, particularly among self-pay patients who expected a comprehensive, all-in-one package.

Another common area of criticism centers on the customer service experience related to **prescription fulfillment and insurance prior authorization**. Since the Sesame platform is a direct-pay service, the onus is on the user and the clinician to work with external pharmacies and insurance companies to secure coverage. Some users report frustration with delays in receiving their medication, citing slow turnaround times on paperwork required to overcome insurance hurdles. Establishing a high level of **trust and transparency** is crucial for patients, and some feel this has been compromised by the disconnect between the low subscription fee and the high true cost of their treatment plan.

### The Takeaway: Assessing the Value Proposition for Different Members

Ultimately, the value of the Costco weight loss program is highly dependent on the individual member's health insurance coverage for GLP-1 medications.

For **Insured Members** whose policy covers the drug, the program represents an excellent value proposition. They receive a discounted, convenient, and medically authoritative path to accessing effective treatment, backed by established clinical protocols. The $179 subscription cost is a minimal investment for immediate access to high-quality care.

For **Uninsured or Self-Pay Members**, the value is much less clear. While the clinical service is excellent and the initial fee is low, the recurring, high monthly cost of the name-brand medication may render the entire program financially prohibitive. For this group, the program serves as a useful diagnostic and prescription service, but it does not solve the fundamental cost problem of the most expensive component of the treatment plan. Therefore, a thorough financial calculation is the essential prerequisite to enrollment.


## Deciding If the Program is Right for You: Alternatives and Key Considerations

The Costco weight loss program, powered by the telehealth platform Sesame, offers a clear path to medically supervised weight management. However, before enrolling, it is crucial to assess your candidacy, understand the regulatory environment of the medications involved, and compare this model to other available options. This will help ensure the program aligns with your health needs and financial expectations.

### Eligibility Checklist: Are You a Candidate for Telehealth Weight Management?

The convenience of a virtual medical weight loss program is one of its greatest appeals, but successful engagement requires certain technical and behavioral readiness. Candidates should have a **stable internet connection** and be comfortable with live video consultations, as the virtual doctor visit is mandatory for obtaining any prescriptions. You must also be ready to engage with the clinical requirements, which include being **willing to complete necessary lab work** (which the clinician orders but the patient pays for) and honestly committing to the recommended **lifestyle changes** (dietary adjustments and increased physical activity). The program is designed for individuals who are ready to integrate pharmacological tools with these behavioral modifications.

### Alternative Options: Direct-to-Consumer GLP-1 Platforms vs. Traditional Doctors

The rise of GLP-1 medications has led to a proliferation of options, broadly divided between specialized direct-to-consumer (DTC) telehealth platforms (like the Costco/Sesame offering) and traditional in-person care from a primary care physician (PCP) or specialist.

The **DTC Telehealth Model** excels in accessibility, often allowing for rapid prescription fulfillment and offering continuous digital support. However, it can sometimes create a disjointed experience, especially if you already have a comprehensive care team. **Traditional Care** provides a more integrated, holistic view of your health, as your PCP or endocrinologist is already aware of your full medical history and other medications. While it may involve more administrative hurdles (appointments, referrals), it is typically better for patients with complex, co-existing medical conditions. A Sermo survey of primary care physicians found that **67% were concerned about the potential health risks** when patients accessed GLP-1 prescriptions for weight loss through a third-party telehealth company, citing concerns over clinically inappropriate prescribing and continuity of care. This underscores the need for patient caution and transparency regardless of the chosen route.

### The Importance of Doctor-Patient Communication and Transparency

For patients with existing complex medical conditions, such as poorly controlled diabetes, kidney disease, or a history of specific gastrointestinal issues, **consulting with a primary care physician (PCP) or specialist before enrolling** in *any* third-party telehealth program is strongly advised. This ensures a comprehensive risk assessment that a new, virtual-only clinician might miss without a full patient record.

Furthermore, compliance and patient safety are paramount, especially given the popularity of certain medications. The **FDA has issued warnings** against using unauthorized or compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs that are essentially copies of commercially available, approved medications. These compounded versions, which may be offered by some less-regulated platforms, are not subject to the rigorous quality and safety review processes of the FDA-approved products (Ozempic, Wegovy, etc.). Patients must ensure that any prescribed medication is sourced from a licensed pharmacy and is the **FDA-approved version**, as product quality and dosing in compounded drugs have been questioned by the agency, posing unnecessary risk to patient health. The Costco/Sesame program prescribes the FDA-approved medications, provided they are available, but patients remain responsible for ensuring the final pharmacy dispensing meets all regulatory standards.

## Your Top Questions About the Costco Program Answered

### Q1. Is the Costco Weight Loss Program available outside the US?

The Costco Weight Loss Program, offered in partnership with the telehealth platform Sesame, is currently available **only to Costco members residing in the United States**. Since the service is delivered virtually by US-licensed clinicians and is tied to the US operations of both Costco and Sesame, it is not accessible to members in other international markets where Costco operates, such as Canada, Mexico, or the UK. This geographical limitation is a key factor for international Costco members to note when considering this specific wellness benefit.

### Q2. Does my regular health insurance cover the Sesame program fee?

No, the initial program fee of \$179 for a three-month subscription is a direct-pay service, meaning **Sesame does not accept or bill health insurance** for the virtual consultation and ongoing support component. This approach is fundamental to the platform's ability to offer transparent, upfront, and competitive pricing for its services. To reinforce this point of transparency, medical experts note that while the program subscription itself is out-of-pocket, clinicians on the Sesame platform *can* assist by providing the necessary documentation, such as pre-authorization paperwork, to help patients secure coverage for any **prescribed weight loss medications** (like GLP-1 drugs) through their existing health insurance plan. Patients can also often use flexible spending accounts (FSAs) or health savings accounts (HSAs) for the program fee, making the payment process more manageable.

### Q3. How long does the virtual consultation process take?

One of the significant advantages of this telehealth model is the speed of access. Initial virtual consultations are typically scheduled **within days** of enrollment, a much shorter wait time than is often experienced with in-person specialist appointments. The session itself usually lasts between **15 to 30 minutes**. During this time, the licensed clinician performs a detailed review of the patient's medical history, current health status, and specific weight management goals. The focus is on a comprehensive evaluation to establish clinical appropriateness, which is the foundational first step to building a personalized treatment plan, whether or not a prescription for medication is ultimately warranted.

## Final Takeaways: Mastering Medical Weight Loss in 2026

The Costco Weight Loss Program, facilitated through the telehealth platform Sesame, represents a significant development in accessible, medically-supervised weight management. This convenience, however, comes with nuances that determine its overall value.

The program is undoubtedly a convenient entry point to obtaining a prescription for GLP-1 medications and receiving professional clinical guidance. However, for a user to achieve success, two critical elements must align: being completely prepared for the *total* cost of any prescribed medication and having an unwavering commitment to the necessary, long-term lifestyle changes. Our analysis shows that users who understand and budget for the medication costs—which often exceed the initial program fee—report a much higher satisfaction rate and are more likely to see sustained results, confirming the program’s value when viewed holistically.

### 3 Key Actionable Steps Before Enrolling in the Program

To ensure the Costco/Sesame program is the right fit for your health and financial picture, take these three actionable steps:

1.  **Verify Your Insurance Coverage:** Call your pharmacy benefits provider *before* enrolling to check if semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) or tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) is covered for weight loss. Ask about required steps, like prior authorization.
2.  **Calculate the True Cost:** If your insurance won't cover the medication, budget for the self-pay rate, which typically falls between \$950 to \$1,600 per month, and factor this into your long-term health budget. The \$179 program fee is just the clinical access cost.
3.  **Prepare for Commitment:** Commit to integrating the required dietary changes and exercise routines into your life. The medications are tools; sustained success requires you to adopt the comprehensive lifestyle modifications that the clinicians will recommend.

### Your Next Step Toward Informed Weight Management

Your immediate next step should be to **calculate your potential out-of-pocket costs for medication *before* paying the program fee**, based on your insurance and the self-pay rate. This crucial step will prevent unexpected financial burden and ensure you can fully adhere to the treatment plan recommended by the clinician.
