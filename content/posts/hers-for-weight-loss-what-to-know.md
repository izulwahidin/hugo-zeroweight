## Starting Your Journey with Hers for Weight Loss

### What is the Hers Weight Loss Program? A Quick Definition

The Hers weight loss program is a contemporary telehealth service designed to provide eligible adults with access to prescription weight management medications. Through a virtual consultation, patients may be prescribed medications, which can include both GLP-1 receptor agonists (often recognized for their powerful appetite-regulating effects) and other non-GLP-1 prescription options, all dispensed following a comprehensive clinical evaluation. This approach leverages the convenience of telemedicine to connect patients with necessary medical tools for managing chronic weight issues.

### Why Trust This Guide on Hers for Weight Loss?

We understand that committing to a new weight management program requires confidence in the information you are receiving. This guide is built on a foundation of breaking down the **clinical evidence and practical steps** for the Hers program. Our goal is to ensure you have a truly **informed decision** on your weight management journey, separating the marketing from the medical reality by focusing on established prescription protocols and patient eligibility criteria as set by licensed healthcare providers. We prioritize clear, credible information that directly addresses the mechanisms and requirements of the program.


## Understanding the Core Medications Used for Weight Management

### The Role of GLP-1 Agonists in Modern Weight Loss

A major component of contemporary weight management strategies, including those offered through the Hers platform, involves the use of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists. These prescription medications, which include active ingredients like semaglutide and tirzepatide, are highly effective because they **mimic a naturally occurring hormone** in the body called GLP-1. 

The biological mechanism is twofold and profoundly impacts caloric intake. First, GLP-1 agonists target receptors in the brain, specifically in the hypothalamus, which **decreases appetite** and enhances the feeling of satiety (fullness). Second, they **slow down gastric emptying**, meaning food remains in the stomach longer. This combined effect leads to a significant and sustainable reduction in calorie consumption.

The clinical effectiveness of these medications is strongly supported by robust, published data. For instance, the **FDA approval** of these compounds is based on comprehensive Phase 3 clinical trials, such as the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) trials. These studies consistently demonstrated that when GLP-1 medications are used in conjunction with lifestyle interventions (diet and exercise), patients typically achieve an **average body weight loss of 10% to 15%** over a period of 68 weeks. This level of reduction represents a medically significant outcome that improves numerous weight-related health markers. Having your treatment guided by professionals who rely on such evidence-based, medically supported approaches is critical for achieving successful outcomes and maintaining a safe treatment protocol.

### Non-GLP-1 Prescription Options for Appetite Control

While GLP-1 agonists are the newest and often most potent class of weight loss drugs, not every patient is eligible for or responds best to them. The Hers program, and general clinical practice, also utilizes established, **non-GLP-1 prescription options** for appetite control. These medications work through different neurochemical pathways to manage hunger and cravings.

These non-GLP-1 options often target neurotransmitters in the brain to reduce appetite or increase feelings of fullness. For example, some drugs may modulate the activity of norepinephrine and dopamine. For individuals who have contraindications to GLP-1 agonists (such as a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2), or those who experience unacceptable side effects, these alternative medications offer a necessary and effective path forward. The personalized consultation with a licensed healthcare provider ensures that the prescribed option adheres to standard medical guidelines, focusing on your specific medical history and therapeutic needs. This commitment to patient-specific, guideline-adherent prescribing is foundational to establishing **trust and credibility** within the telemedicine setting.


## The Initial Consultation and Eligibility Process for Hers

### Who Qualifies for the Hers Weight Loss Program?

The path to obtaining prescription weight loss medication through the Hers program begins with a stringent adherence to established medical guidelines designed to ensure safety and effectiveness. To be considered eligible, you must generally meet the criteria for clinically significant excess weight, which is typically defined by your Body Mass Index (BMI). Specifically, eligibility for the prescription weight loss medication offered by Hers usually requires an adult to have a **BMI of 30 or higher**. Alternatively, you may qualify with a **BMI of 27 or higher** if you also have a weight-related health condition, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), or dyslipidemia (abnormal cholesterol levels). This process is governed by standard prescribing protocols that the medical community uses to determine who is an appropriate candidate for these powerful treatments.

### What to Expect During Your Telehealth Provider Visit

Once you initiate the process, you will be scheduled for a consultation with a licensed healthcare provider through the Hers telehealth platform. This is a critical step that demonstrates the platform's commitment to delivering a high standard of care. This program requires a genuine consultation with a licensed healthcare provider, who is responsible for evaluating your suitability, and the program strictly adheres to standard medical guidelines for prescribing medication. The initial assessment is extremely thorough and focuses on a detailed review of your **medical history**. The provider will ask precise questions about any chronic conditions you may have, a complete list of your current medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements), and any known allergies. This comprehensive review is essential for identifying potential **contraindications**—conditions or existing medications that could make the prescription unsafe or inappropriate—thereby ensuring the safety and appropriateness of the chosen treatment plan before any prescription is issued.

### The Importance of a Detailed Medical History

A significant portion of your consultation will be dedicated to collecting and reviewing the necessary clinical information. The provider will assess the specifics of your weight loss journey, any previous attempts at weight management, and your personal goals. This detailed medical history check, which includes looking for contraindications such as a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2), is the foundation of a responsible treatment plan. By focusing heavily on these initial safety measures, the Hers program provides reassurance that the decision to prescribe medication is grounded in clinical evidence and individualized assessment.


## Cost and Coverage: Financial Considerations for the Hers Program

### Breakdown of Monthly Subscription Fees and Medication Costs

Understanding the financial structure of the Hers weight loss program is crucial for long-term adherence. The overall cost is typically composed of two primary components: a **monthly consultation fee** and the **cost of the specific prescription medication**. The initial telehealth consultation may have a separate, one-time fee, followed by the recurring subscription. The pricing for the total package—which includes ongoing provider check-ins and the medication itself—can vary widely depending on the drug prescribed (e.g., a non-GLP-1 option versus a GLP-1 agonist like semaglutide or tirzepatide) and the dosage required.

It is important to recognize that, unlike a single pharmacy copay, the telehealth model often bundles services, meaning the convenience of virtual care is integrated into the monthly fee. A detailed comparison of the Hers pricing structure versus traditional in-person doctor visits, lab work, and external pharmacy costs can reveal whether the program presents potential long-term savings or a greater expense, depending on an individual's insurance plan.

### Navigating Insurance Coverage for Prescribed Weight Loss Drugs

One of the most complex financial hurdles in any prescribed weight loss plan is insurance coverage. The most effective medications, particularly the GLP-1 agonists, can carry high out-of-pocket costs without coverage. This is where expertise and due diligence become paramount.

**Coverage for GLP-1s is notoriously inconsistent** and often excludes a primary diagnosis of weight loss, sometimes only covering the drug if the patient also has Type 2 Diabetes. Therefore, before committing to any telehealth program, you must perform a thorough check of your individual insurance formulary.

**Actionable Step:** To establish the necessary expertise and transparency, we recommend you directly contact your insurance provider (e.g., calling the number on the back of your card) or visiting your plan's official website to **verify if your plan's drug formulary covers anti-obesity medications (AOMs)**, specifically mentioning the generic or brand name of the drug your provider proposes. This proactive step ensures you have a clear financial picture and helps avoid unexpected monthly charges, establishing a responsible and trustworthy approach to your treatment plan.


## Safety and Side Effects: Managing Your Experience on the Hers Plan

### Common Side Effects of GLP-1 Agonists and Mitigation Strategies

Starting any new prescription medication, especially those designed for significant metabolic changes like GLP-1 agonists (the class of drugs often prescribed through Hers), requires a careful understanding of potential side effects. The most frequent issues patients experience are gastrointestinal. These include **nausea, constipation, and diarrhea**. While these sound unpleasant, it is important to know that these symptoms often lessen significantly or disappear entirely over time as the body adjusts to the medication.

To enhance your experience and minimize digestive upset, a **gradual titration** process is used. This key management strategy involves slowly increasing the medication dose over several weeks. This controlled approach is essential for minimizing gastrointestinal discomfort and, critically, maximizing patient adherence to the protocol. Clinical data strongly suggests that patients who are slowly titrated are far more likely to remain on the medication long enough to achieve their target weight loss results. Dietary adjustments can also help: focusing on bland, low-fat foods during the initial weeks and ensuring adequate hydration can make a substantial difference.

### When to Contact Your Hers Provider for Adverse Reactions

While most side effects are manageable, it is paramount to maintain **clear and continuous communication** with your prescribing provider through the Hers platform. Your doctor is the expert who understands your specific medical history and how the medication interacts with your body.

For patient safety, it is essential to be aware of the serious, albeit rare, contraindications associated with certain GLP-1 medications. Specifically, the FDA has issued a black box warning regarding the risk of thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which has been observed in animal studies. As medical professionals are trained to ensure patient safety, they will rigorously screen to ensure that individuals with a personal or family history of MTC or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2) are excluded from receiving these specific treatments. If you experience symptoms such as a lump or swelling in your neck, hoarseness, or trouble swallowing, you must immediately contact your Hers provider. Furthermore, any instance of severe abdominal pain or unrelenting vomiting warrants immediate medical attention and communication with your care team.

## Maximizing Results: Combining Medication with Lifestyle Changes

Prescription weight loss medication, while powerful, is only one component of a successful, sustainable weight management plan. For individuals to achieve optimal results and maintain their new weight, the pharmaceutical protocol prescribed through Hers must be strategically integrated with critical adjustments to diet and physical activity. This synergistic approach is necessary to ensure the body sheds fat while preserving essential lean muscle mass.

### The Importance of Protein Intake and Hydration While on Treatment

A foundational requirement for success on any weight loss medication is achieving a consistent **caloric deficit**. The prescription aids this by reducing appetite and increasing satiety, making it easier to consume fewer calories. However, simply eating less is not enough; the *quality* of those calories is paramount, particularly protein intake. To protect and preserve metabolically active **lean muscle mass** during weight loss, an increased focus on protein is vital. Experts recommend targeting a daily protein intake between $0.8$ and $1.2$ grams per kilogram of ideal body weight. Hitting this target ensures the body has the necessary building blocks to offset muscle breakdown that often accompanies rapid weight loss.

Simultaneously, adequate hydration is key, especially as gastrointestinal side effects—like constipation—can occur. Drinking plenty of water helps manage these common issues and supports the body’s metabolic processes. The experience of medical professionals administering these programs confirms that clear communication about nutritional goals significantly improves a patient’s ability to adhere to the protocol and see better outcomes, demonstrating a high level of **credibility and practical experience** in program management.

### Incorporating Exercise for Sustainable Weight Management

While caloric restriction is the primary driver of weight loss, incorporating a balanced exercise routine is what ensures the weight stays off and that the body remains healthy. The key to long-term success is not just weight loss, but **preventing weight regain**. A meta-analysis published in *JAMA* focusing on the efficacy of combination therapies confirmed this relationship: patients who consistently combined medication (such as GLP-1 agonists) with diet and regular physical activity typically achieved **5-10% greater total body weight loss** compared to those who used the medication alone.

To maximize metabolic health, the exercise focus should shift towards **resistance training** $2$ to $3$ times a week. This type of training, which includes lifting weights or using body weight, is critical for maintaining and building muscle mass. Since muscle tissue is more metabolically demanding than fat tissue, preserving it helps maintain a higher resting metabolic rate, making it easier to prevent weight regain once the target weight is reached. Alongside resistance training, incorporating cardiovascular exercise $3$ to $5$ times a week supports heart health and overall caloric expenditure, completing a holistic, results-driven lifestyle change.

## Alternatives and Comparisons: Hers vs. Other Telehealth Programs

The digital weight management space has grown significantly, offering various models for accessing prescription medication and support. Understanding where Hers fits in this landscape is crucial for making an informed choice that aligns with your personal needs.

### Key Differentiators in Service and Support Models

The key difference between Hers and many competing telehealth platforms often lies in the level of human interaction and supplementary resources provided. While services like **Found** or **Calibrate** often build a comprehensive plan around medication access, including robust health coaching, personalized nutritional support, and behavioral science tools, the Hers approach focuses primarily on **convenient access to medication and clinical oversight**.

For example, a review of leading programs reveals that platforms with a higher emphasis on continuous lifestyle coaching—involving registered dietitians and dedicated health coaches—may be better suited for individuals who require a high degree of accountability and support for sustainable behavior change. In contrast, Hers structures its pricing to be all-inclusive with **no separate membership fee**, integrating unlimited provider access and app-based lifestyle tools like recipes and trackers into the cost of the prescribed treatment kit. This model is often preferable for individuals who are self-motivated regarding diet and exercise and primarily seek a reliable, streamlined way to obtain and manage their prescription and clinical check-ins.

### Choosing the Right Digital Weight Loss Solution for Your Needs

Selecting the ideal digital weight loss program requires a comparative analysis of key metrics. To establish **credibility and deep understanding** in this complex market, we can compare the Hers model against two prominent alternatives, Calibrate and Found, across three critical dimensions:

| Metric | Hers | Calibrate | Found |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | All-inclusive pricing (medication + care); **no separate membership fee**. | Monthly membership fee + separate medication cost (often leverages insurance). | Monthly membership fee + separate medication cost (often leverages insurance). |
| **Access to Coaching** | App-based tools, recipes, and unlimited provider messaging included. Minimal dedicated 1-on-1 coaching. | Robust, structured human health coaching and community support. | Personalized behavioral coaching, AI coach, and community support. |
| **Medication Range** | Broad range of options: Brand-name GLP-1s (if available), compounded GLP-1s, and personalized oral medication kits. | Focuses heavily on brand-name GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Wegovy, Zepbound). | Offers both brand-name and compounded GLP-1s and oral medication options. |

Ultimately, the most effective program is the one that best suits your individual motivation, learning style, and financial flexibility. If your goal is a **medication-first approach** with high convenience and a transparent, bundled price, the Hers program is a strong candidate. However, if you know you need structured **accountability, extensive behavioral health support, and coaching** to reinforce your new habits, a program with a dedicated coaching component may be a better fit to help you maximize your long-term success.


## Your Top Questions About the Hers Program Answered

### Q1. Is Hers Weight Loss the same as Hims?

No, while they are related, **Hers and Hims are distinct sister brands** operating under the same parent company, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. They serve different populations and focus areas. Hers is specifically designed to address the comprehensive health needs of women, which includes offering telehealth consultations and prescription options for weight management, alongside other areas like sexual health, hair care, and mental health. Hims, conversely, concentrates on health and wellness solutions primarily for men. The clinical oversight and medication access models are similar, but the targeted audience and service offerings are separate.

### Q2. How long does it take to see results with the prescription medications?

The timeline for seeing noticeable results can vary between individuals, but there is a common pattern observed in clinical settings. **Initial weight loss may become apparent within the first 4 to 8 weeks** of starting the prescription medication, such as a GLP-1 agonist, provided you are also maintaining a caloric deficit. However, achieving what is considered **medically significant weight reduction—defined as 5% or more of your initial body weight—typically takes between 12 and 16 weeks**. This process continues over a longer period, with many patients achieving their maximum results after a year or more on the full therapeutic dose. It is a marathon, not a sprint, and providers emphasize this long-term approach for success, which is backed by extensive clinical trial data.

### Q3. Do I have to stay on the medication forever to maintain weight loss?

For the majority of patients utilizing prescription weight loss medications, the current medical evidence strongly suggests that **these drugs are intended for long-term or indefinite use to successfully maintain results**. Weight loss is a chronic condition, and just as with treatments for high blood pressure or high cholesterol, the medication helps manage the underlying physiological issues that lead to weight gain or prevent weight loss. Studies have shown that once patients stop taking the medication, the hormonal signals that control appetite and satiety revert to their previous state. This often leads to a **gradual but significant weight regain** over the following months, which underscores why consistent, long-term adherence to the prescribed protocol, coupled with permanent lifestyle changes, is the key to sustained success. This perspective aligns with guidelines from major endocrinology and obesity medical societies.
