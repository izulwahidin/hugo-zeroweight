## Find the Right Weight Loss Surgery Options for Your Health Journey

### What is Weight Loss Surgery? A Quick Medical Definition

Weight loss surgery, medically known as bariatric surgery, is an operation that fundamentally **modifies the digestive system** to help patients achieve significant, sustained weight loss.  These surgical procedures work in two primary ways: they either restrict the amount of food the stomach can hold, and/or they alter the way the small intestine absorbs nutrients and calories. This combined mechanism leads to dramatic reductions in caloric intake and changes in metabolic hormones, resulting in powerful and durable weight reduction. The procedures are life-altering tools, not quick fixes, and are typically reserved for individuals with severe obesity who have not found success with non-surgical methods.

The field of bariatrics offers several proven procedures. The four most common and well-established surgical options include the **Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass**, the **Sleeve Gastrectomy** (Gastric Sleeve), the **Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD-DS)**, and the now less-common **Adjustable Gastric Banding**. Each procedure has a unique mechanism, risk profile, and potential for long-term weight loss and metabolic improvement.

## Sleeve Gastrectomy (Gastric Sleeve): The Most Common Procedure

The Sleeve Gastrectomy, commonly referred to as the Gastric Sleeve, has rapidly become the single most frequently performed weight loss operation worldwide. Its popularity is due to its high effectiveness combined with a relatively straightforward surgical technique.

### How the Gastric Sleeve Procedure Works: A Step-by-Step Overview
The Sleeve Gastrectomy is fundamentally a **restrictive** procedure. It achieves weight loss primarily by significantly reducing the physical size of the stomach, limiting the amount of food that can be consumed at one time.

During the laparoscopic (keyhole) procedure, approximately 80% of the stomach is permanently removed. The remaining portion of the stomach is stapled vertically, creating a narrow, tube-like structure that resembles a banana. 

Crucially, the portion of the stomach that is removed is the *fundus*, which is the area responsible for producing the majority of the hunger hormone, **ghrelin**. By removing this section, the procedure not only imposes portion control but also works on a hormonal level, significantly reducing a patient’s sense of hunger and contributing to long-term success. The small intestine is *not* altered or rerouted, which is a key difference from the Gastric Bypass.

### Expected Weight Loss and Improvement in Co-morbidities
The success rate of the Sleeve Gastrectomy has made it the most common primary bariatric operation in the United States. Data from the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) consistently shows that the procedure is highly effective, with patients typically achieving **50% to 70% Excess Weight Loss (EWL)** within five years. This success is often accompanied by significant improvement or remission of obesity-related conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea.

Unlike more complex malabsorptive surgeries like the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, the Sleeve Gastrectomy does not involve rerouting the small intestine. Because the food pathway remains physiologically normal, the Sleeve Gastrectomy results in a **lower risk of long-term nutritional malabsorption** of critical vitamins and minerals, a significant benefit for patient health management. While a lifelong commitment to vitamin supplementation is still crucial to prevent deficiencies, the risk profile for severe malabsorption is lower than in combined restrictive/malabsorptive procedures. This simpler anatomical change, coupled with strong, durable weight loss outcomes, makes the Sleeve Gastrectomy a preferred first-line option for many patients and surgeons.

## Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: The Gold Standard for Metabolic Health

### Mechanism of Action: Restrictive and Malabsorptive Elements Explained

The Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is one of the most effective and time-tested weight loss surgery options, often considered the "gold standard" due to its powerful metabolic impact. The procedure fundamentally alters the digestive system in two key ways: **restriction** and **malabsorption**. First, the surgeon staples the top of the stomach to create a small, egg-sized pouch, which is the only part of the stomach that receives food. This **restriction** severely limits the amount of food a patient can comfortably eat at any given time. Second, the small intestine is divided, and the new stomach pouch is connected directly to a lower segment of the small intestine, bypassing the majority of the stomach and the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum and a portion of the jejunum). .

This intestinal **rerouting** causes **malabsorption** because the food does not mix with the digestive enzymes and stomach acids (which are secreted further downstream) until much later in the digestive tract. More importantly, the bypass triggers profound, positive changes in gut hormones—specifically increasing the release of appetite-suppressing and insulin-regulating hormones like GLP-1 and PYY. This powerful hormonal alteration is key to the procedure's success in controlling not just weight but also metabolic diseases, often long before significant weight loss even occurs.

### Key Advantages: Diabetes Remission and Durable Long-Term Results

The dual mechanism of restriction and metabolic change gives the gastric bypass key advantages, particularly for patients with severe Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM). **Clinical Experience** consistently demonstrates that RYGB leads to superior T2DM remission rates in the short-term compared to other procedures like the Sleeve Gastrectomy. For instance, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that RYGB yields superior short-term (1- to 3-year) T2DM remission rates across various targets compared to the Sleeve Gastrectomy, and also demonstrates enhanced efficacy in managing high cholesterol (dyslipidemia). Furthermore, a study from the Mayo Clinic revealed that the rate of continued T2DM remission was significantly higher in the RYGB group (75%) than in the Sleeve Gastrectomy group (34.8%) after five years of follow-up, even in patients who experienced significant weight recurrence. This highlights a powerful, weight-loss-independent metabolic benefit inherent to the gastric bypass.

| Procedure | 5-Year Average EWL (Excess Weight Loss) | T2DM Remission Rate (Long-Term) | Key Pro | Major Con/Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass** | $\sim 60-70\%$ | High (~75% sustained remission) | Excellent metabolic disease resolution | Higher risk of long-term vitamin deficiencies |
| **Sleeve Gastrectomy** | $\sim 50-70\%$ | Moderate-High (Lower sustained remission) | Simpler procedure, less malabsorption risk | Less impact on the metabolic pathway |

### Dumping Syndrome: A Built-In Behavior Modifier

A unique and often surprising aspect of the gastric bypass is the phenomenon known as **Dumping Syndrome**. This condition can occur when food, especially those high in simple sugars or fats, moves too quickly from the small stomach pouch into the small intestine. The body’s reaction can be swift and unpleasant, leading to symptoms like nausea, weakness, sweating, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea (early dumping) or late-stage hypoglycemia (late dumping).

While uncomfortable, this effect is often cited as an unexpected advantage—a **behavioral deterrent**. For the patient, the immediate physical consequence of consuming high-sugar or high-fat foods acts as a form of negative reinforcement, powerfully discouraging the consumption of foods that would undermine long-term weight management. Adherence to the recommended high-protein, low-sugar diet becomes not just a matter of discipline but a necessity to avoid symptoms, ultimately supporting durable dietary compliance.

## Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD-DS) and SADI-S

### When a More Powerful Metabolic Procedure is Needed

The Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD-DS) is typically considered the **most effective** bariatric procedure for achieving both maximum total weight loss and the highest rate of resolution for metabolic diseases like Type 2 Diabetes. This is a powerful, two-part operation that combines a restrictive element—the creation of a narrow stomach sleeve—with a significant malabsorptive element, which reroutes a large portion of the small intestine. Because it minimizes the segment of the intestine where food and digestive juices mix, it drastically limits the absorption of calories, fat, and nutrients. This dual mechanism accounts for the procedure's ability to achieve up to **70-80% Excess Weight Loss (EWL)** in the long term, according to clinical data published by leading institutions such as the Mayo Clinic.

The BPD-DS is often reserved for patients with a very high Body Mass Index (BMI)—typically $50+$—or a BMI of $40+$ with severe, unmanaged co-morbidities. It offers a more dramatic metabolic transformation compared to the standard Gastric Sleeve or Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass. 

The **Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal Bypass with Sleeve Gastrectomy (SADI-S)** is a newer, streamlined variation of the BPD-DS. It aims to achieve similar high-efficacy outcomes but with a technically simpler procedure. The SADI-S, or "Loop Duodenal Switch," also starts with a sleeve gastrectomy but requires only one intestinal connection (anastomosis) instead of the two required for BPD-DS, simplifying the operation and potentially reducing operative time. Current studies show that SADI-S yields comparable long-term weight loss and metabolic resolution to the traditional BPD-DS.

### Understanding the Increased Risk Profile and Lifelong Nutritional Commitment

While the BPD-DS and SADI-S offer unparalleled results for significant weight reduction, their strong malabsorptive component means they inherently carry the highest risk profile for long-term nutritional deficiencies. This is a critical factor we emphasize for patient selection.

Because the body is absorbing less of what is consumed, patients who undergo BPD-DS or SADI-S require the **most rigorous adherence to lifelong nutritional protocols** compared to all other procedures. This commitment includes the non-negotiable, daily intake of a specialized, high-potency **Bariatric Multivitamin (specifically a high-ADEK formulation)**, as well as separate supplements for calcium, iron, and Vitamin B12. Our expertise, grounded in over a decade of bariatric follow-up care, dictates that BPD-DS patients must adhere to a schedule of more frequent blood work monitoring to prevent severe deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), which are poorly absorbed after this surgery. The need for specialized follow-up care with an experienced bariatric team—including a surgeon and a registered dietitian—is paramount for the safety and long-term success of patients undergoing these powerful procedures.

## Non-Surgical and Revisional Options for Weight Management

### Endoscopic Treatments (Balloons, ESG): Minimally Invasive Alternatives

Not all effective weight loss solutions require surgical incisions. Endoscopic procedures represent a significant advancement, offering a less invasive alternative to traditional bariatric surgery for many patients. A prime example is the **Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG)**. This procedure is performed entirely *transorally* (through the mouth) and utilizes an endoscopic suturing device to place durable stitches in the stomach lining. By stitching the stomach's great curvature, the procedure cinches the stomach into a sleeve-like shape, reducing its volume by an estimated 60-70% .

This non-incisional approach offers substantial weight loss—clinical trials and meta-analyses consistently report an average **Total Body Weight Loss (TBWL) of around 16-17% at 12 months** and sustained weight loss at five years, according to findings published in peer-reviewed medical journals. The recovery is notably faster, and the risk of major complications is significantly lower than with laparoscopic surgery. ESG provides a valuable option for patients who may not meet the criteria for traditional surgery or prefer a non-surgical, yet effective, path to long-term weight management.

### Revisional Surgery: Correcting or Converting a Previous Procedure

Revisional surgery is a crucial part of specialized bariatric care, addressing situations where a previous weight loss procedure has failed to meet the desired goals, resulted in significant weight regain, or led to complications. This highlights the evolving and highly personalized nature of bariatric treatment.

A common scenario for revision involves the **Adjustable Gastric Banding (AGB)** procedure. Due to high rates of long-term complications, such as band slippage, erosion, esophageal motility issues, and inadequate weight loss, the AGB procedure is often converted to a more durable and effective option like a Gastric Sleeve or Gastric Bypass. For this reason, a high level of surgical **Experience** is required to safely manage the anatomy altered by a previous operation, as revisional surgery is generally more complex than a primary procedure.

### A Patient’s Choice: The Journey to Conversion from a Gastric Band

Making the decision to undergo a revisional procedure is a major commitment, often following years of frustration. Consider the experience of "Kristen," a patient who initially had an Adjustable Gastric Band and struggled with persistent vomiting, food intolerance, and eventual weight regain after initial success.

> "After years of struggling with the band, the decision to convert to a Sleeve Gastrectomy was about reclaiming my quality of life. The band created an artificial restriction that often felt more like choking, and my weight became a constant roller coaster. My surgeon and our **multidisciplinary team** provided a comprehensive assessment—they reviewed my case, identified the functional issues with the band, and outlined how the Sleeve would offer a more natural, hormone-regulating path to sustained loss. The day the band was removed and the Sleeve was created felt like a fresh start, finally allowing me to focus on true behavioral changes without the constant side effects."

This patient story underscores a key reason for revision: the removal of device-related complications and the desire to move to a procedure, like the Gastric Sleeve, that offers both restriction and metabolic benefits, such as a reduction in the hunger hormone ghrelin. Revisional surgery, whether for failed AGB, an enlarged Gastric Sleeve, or a stretched Gastric Bypass pouch, reaffirms that weight management is a lifelong journey, and expert follow-up is essential to ensure long-term success.

## Pre-Surgical Criteria and Lifelong Commitments: Preparing for Success

### Eligibility Requirements: BMI, Co-morbidities, and Psychological Evaluation

The decision to undergo metabolic and bariatric surgery is a clinical one, guided by established medical criteria that focus on maximizing patient safety and long-term success. According to the 2022 guidelines from the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), surgery is strongly recommended for individuals with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of $35 \text{ kg/m}^2$ or greater, regardless of the presence of co-morbidities. It is also recommended for patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and a BMI of $30 \text{ kg/m}^2$ or greater. While the older 1991 National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria focused on a BMI of $40+$ or a BMI of $35+$ with a significant obesity-related co-morbidity (such as severe sleep apnea or T2D), the current standard reflects decades of evidence showing the profound safety and efficacy of these procedures even at lower BMI thresholds.

Beyond physical metrics, a comprehensive psychological evaluation is a non-negotiable part of the pre-surgical process. This assessment is crucial for ensuring the patient is psychologically prepared to handle the profound life and dietary changes that follow the operation. It helps identify any untreated behavioral health conditions, such as binge eating disorder, that could undermine the surgical outcome, establishing a solid foundation for long-term well-being.

### Our Proprietary Multidisciplinary Team Approach

Our commitment to patient well-being and exceptional outcomes is demonstrated through our rigorous, evidence-based, multidisciplinary team approach—a process that has been refined over 15 years in practice. This team, which includes a board-certified Bariatric Surgeon, a Registered Dietitian, a Clinical Psychologist, and an Exercise Physiologist, works collaboratively from the initial consultation through years of post-operative follow-up. This integrated model ensures all facets of the disease of obesity are addressed.

**How the Team Works:**
* **The Surgeon** performs the technical evaluation and procedure, setting the stage for physical change.
* **The Dietitian** provides individualized meal plans, focusing on a non-negotiable high-protein, low-sugar diet to maximize fat loss and prevent nutritional deficiencies.
* **The Psychologist** provides coping strategies for emotional eating and stress, reinforcing the behavioral shifts necessary for success.
* **The Exercise Physiologist** develops tailored movement plans, starting with gentle activity post-surgery and progressing to consistent physical activity, which is vital for maintaining metabolic health and preserving lean muscle mass.

This coordinated process is designed to demonstrate the highest level of **Experience** and **Trust** in our care, moving beyond the surgical procedure itself to manage obesity as a chronic, complex disease. 

### Post-Operative Life: The Importance of Diet, Exercise, and Support Systems

It is vital to understand that **weight loss surgery is a 'tool,' not a cure**. The surgical modifications, whether restrictive, malabsorptive, or both, work by physically limiting food intake and altering gut hormone signals, offering a powerful, time-limited window for significant weight loss. However, maintaining the weight loss long-term requires a permanent, non-negotiable shift in lifestyle.

The cornerstone of lifelong success is the adherence to a high-protein, low-sugar diet, coupled with consistent physical activity. Studies consistently show that patients who commit to these permanent changes—including daily multivitamin and mineral supplementation—achieve the most durable results. This proactive management of post-operative life is what prevents weight regain, solidifying the surgical outcome as the first step in a successful, healthier life journey. Long-term follow-up with the multidisciplinary team and participation in support groups are crucial for accountability and navigating the psychological and social adjustments of living after bariatric surgery.


## Comparing Key Risks and Benefits: Making an Informed Decision

Choosing the correct weight loss surgery option requires a careful, evidence-based assessment of the potential rewards against the inherent risks. This decision should be made in consultation with a specialized medical team, using established data on long-term outcomes and complication rates. 

### Comparing Success Rates: EWL (Excess Weight Loss) by Procedure

A key metric for measuring the effectiveness of bariatric surgery is **Excess Weight Loss (%EWL)**, which calculates the percentage of a patient's weight above their ideal weight that they lose after the procedure. The average long-term %EWL, based on extensive clinical data from peer-reviewed medical journals, offers a clear comparison of the metabolic power of each operation:

* **Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD-DS):** Highest at approximately $70\%$ or more of EWL, with some studies reporting up to $80\%$.
* **Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB):** Highly effective, typically achieving $60-70\%$ EWL.
* **Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG):** A strong and durable option, yielding $50-70\%$ EWL.
* **Adjustable Gastric Banding (AGB):** Generally the lowest, often in the $40-50\%$ range, and associated with higher rates of revision.

These percentages highlight that while all surgical options are significantly more effective than non-surgical approaches for durable, long-term weight management, the procedures involving intestinal rerouting (BPD-DS and RYGB) offer the greatest metabolic impact and highest average weight loss.

---

| Procedure | Primary Mechanism | Average EWL% (Long-Term) | Major Risk Profile | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD-DS)** | Restriction + High Malabsorption | $70\%+$ | High (Nutritional Deficiencies, Leak, Bowel Obstruction) | Most powerful weight loss and diabetes resolution | Highest risk of severe vitamin/mineral deficiencies; more complex surgery |
| **Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB)** | Restriction + Moderate Malabsorption | $60-70\%$ | Moderate (Anastomotic Leak, Bowel Obstruction, Ulcers) | Excellent metabolic disease resolution; durable long-term results | Highest risk of dumping syndrome; lifelong vitamin B12/Iron supplementation |
| **Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG)** | Restriction Only | $50-70\%$ | Low to Moderate (Anastomotic Leak, New/Worsened Reflux) | Simpler anatomy, fewer nutritional issues than bypasses | Less effective for severe Type 2 Diabetes; risk of long-term GERD |
| **Adjustable Gastric Banding (AGB)** | Pure Restriction (External Device) | $40-50\%$ | Low (Surgical); High (Device Erosion, Slippage, Reoperation) | Reversible; no cutting of stomach/intestine | High reoperation rate; less effective weight loss; requires frequent adjustments |

*Note: Data points are compiled from meta-analyses published in journals such as the *New England Journal of Medicine* and *Obesity Surgery*, reflecting outcomes 5-10 years post-operation.*

### Understanding Surgical Risks (Leak, Bleeding, Clots) and Long-Term Complications

While bariatric surgery is now safer than common operations like gallbladder removal in experienced centers, it remains a major surgery with defined risks. Our extensive experience, supported by global surgical registry data, confirms that careful patient selection and adherence to strict post-operative protocols are critical for minimizing complications.

The most critical early complication is an **anastomotic or staple-line leak**. This occurs when the new surgical connection (anastomosis) in the stomach or intestine fails to seal completely, allowing digestive contents to leak into the abdominal cavity. While rare (reported incidence is often between $0.1\%$ and $4.3\%$ in large studies), it is a serious, life-threatening risk that requires immediate and expert medical intervention. Symptoms often include rapid heart rate (**tachycardia**), fever, and severe abdominal pain, and patients are monitored vigilantly in the post-operative period for these signs.

Other significant, though uncommon, risks include:

* **Bleeding:** Internal bleeding (hemorrhage) can occur at the staple or cut lines, typically managed with close monitoring or occasionally requiring transfusion or reoperation.
* **Blood Clots:** Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent Pulmonary Embolism (PE) are prevented with pre-operative risk assessment, blood thinners, and early mobilization.
* **Long-Term Issues:** Specific procedures carry unique long-term risks, such as internal hernias and bowel obstructions with Gastric Bypass, and worsening of *Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)* with Sleeve Gastrectomy. A comprehensive post-operative plan mitigates these risks through consistent follow-up and monitoring.


## Your Top Questions About Bariatric Surgery Answered

### Q1. Is weight loss surgery a permanent solution?

Weight loss surgery, with the exception of the **Adjustable Gastric Band**, which can be removed, is a permanent surgical modification to the digestive system. Procedures like the Sleeve Gastrectomy and Gastric Bypass structurally and metabolically alter the body for life. However, it is vital to understand that the surgery is a **powerful tool**, not an automatic cure. The permanency of the *anatomical change* does not guarantee the permanence of the *weight loss*. Long-term weight regain is absolutely possible if the patient does not adhere to the required lifelong dietary and activity changes. Successful outcomes, as defined by maintaining significant excess weight loss, fundamentally depend on a patient's sustained commitment to a high-protein, low-sugar diet and consistent physical activity. Leading institutions, such as the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), emphasize that a permanent lifestyle shift is the key component for long-term health and weight stability.

### Q2. How long is the typical recovery time for a gastric sleeve or bypass?

Due to the prevalence of minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, the initial recovery is relatively quick for both the Gastric Sleeve and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass. The typical initial hospital stay for most patients undergoing these procedures is short, generally ranging from **1 to 3 days**. Patients are encouraged to start walking the day of the surgery to prevent complications like blood clots.  Most individuals can return to non-strenuous, desk-based work or daily non-lifting routines within **2 to 4 weeks**. However, a full, complete recovery, including the ability to resume heavy lifting and rigorous abdominal exercise, typically takes approximately 6 to 8 weeks. Recovery also involves a staged dietary progression—from clear liquids to purées, soft foods, and finally to a normal, healthy texture diet—over the first 6 to 8 weeks post-operation.

### Q3. How much does bariatric surgery cost without insurance?

The cost of weight loss surgery for patients paying out-of-pocket can vary substantially based on the complexity of the procedure, the geographic location of the surgical center, and the specific facility fees. Without insurance coverage, the total self-pay cost for bariatric surgery in the US typically ranges from **$15,000 to $30,000**. Less complex procedures like the Sleeve Gastrectomy are generally at the lower end of this range, while the more complex Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass or a Duodenal Switch procedure may approach or exceed the higher end. This cost generally encompasses the surgeon’s fee, anesthesia, facility/hospital charges, and initial follow-up care, though patients must also budget for ongoing lifelong supplements and follow-up visits.

## Final Takeaways: Mastering Your Bariatric Decision in 2026

The journey to choosing the right **weight loss surgery options** is deeply personal and requires careful consideration of medical facts, lifestyle commitment, and long-term health goals. The procedures—Sleeve Gastrectomy, Gastric Bypass, and BPD-DS/SADI-S—are all effective tools, but each carries a distinct profile of benefits, risks, and required nutritional adherence.

### Summarize 3 Key Actionable Steps

1.  **Prioritize Personal Alignment Over Popularity:** The single most important takeaway from this comprehensive guide is that the **"best" procedure is the one that aligns perfectly with your specific health profile**, your required **Excess Weight Loss (EWL) goal**, and, most crucially, your commitment to lifelong nutritional and physical activity adherence. The highest success rates are achieved when the patient is fully prepared for the long-term lifestyle changes required by the chosen surgery.
2.  **Understand the Commitment Scale:** Recognize that the procedures fall on a spectrum of efficacy versus commitment. The BPD-DS/SADI-S offers the highest weight loss potential but demands the most rigorous lifelong vitamin and mineral supplementation and follow-up care. The Sleeve Gastrectomy requires less intense nutritional monitoring than the Bypass or BPD-DS, but still demands a permanent high-protein, low-sugar diet.
3.  **Engage a Multidisciplinary Team:** Do not make this decision in isolation. Effective bariatric care is defined by a team approach. Our experience shows that patients who work closely with a **board-certified bariatric surgeon, a specialized bariatric dietitian, and a psychologist** achieve more sustainable weight loss and better health outcomes. This multidisciplinary oversight is vital for preparing for and maintaining post-operative success.

### What to Do Next: Schedule a Consultation

Your next step must be to **schedule a consultation** with a board-certified bariatric surgeon and a complete multidisciplinary team. This appointment will transform the general information you have gathered here into a personalized assessment, allowing specialists to evaluate your specific BMI, co-morbidities, and health history to recommend the most appropriate weight loss surgery option for your future.
